The abandoned east wing—closed for renovation according to signs that had weathered beyond legibility—stood in stark contrast to the modern facilities on the hospital's western side. While medical staff tended to patients in brightly lit contemporary wards, the original asylum building waited in darkness, windows either boarded or staring outward like empty eye sockets.</p> <p>The irony wasn't lost on Mick as he sat in his car across the street, observing the building through a light drizzle that distorted the sodium streetlamps into hazy smears of yellow. A century ago, people with mental illness were locked away here. Now it housed something far worse—a facility dedicated to fragmenting consciousness itself, to extracting and storing the essence of beings like Marchosias.</p> <p>Mick checked his watch: 11:47 PM. Reeves wouldn't arrive for another forty minutes. Their plan had been clear—scout the perimeter together, identify security patterns, then approach the east wing entrance after midnight shift change. But as he studied the building, noting the subtle wrongness of the shadows around it—how they seemed to move independently of their sources, stretching toward the ground like roots seeking purchase—Mick knew waiting would only make things harder.</p> <p>"This is reckless," he muttered to himself, missing the sardonic commentary that should have followed such an observation. The silence in his head remained absolute, the void where Marchosias should be an ever-present reminder of what he stood to lose if he failed.</p> <p>He reached into his jacket pocket, feeling the reassuring presence of Eliza's drawings, now laminated to protect them from damage. Beside them sat a small velvet pouch containing the feather Lilaeth had provided—a physical fragment of Marchosias's celestial past, iridescent and impossible, shifting through colors that shouldn't exist when viewed directly.</p> <p>Their second meeting at the Crossroads Club had been brief and businesslike, Lilaeth examining the Blackthorn files with an intensity that made the air around her vibrate at frequencies that hurt Mick's ears. After confirming the intelligence was sufficient, she had summoned the feather from whatever impossible space she used for storage and presented it alongside a small crystal vial containing what looked like dark liquid that moved with unsettling purpose, swirling against the glass as if seeking escape.</p> <p>"The feather serves as both key and beacon," she had explained, her perfect features arranged in an expression of clinical detachment. "Apply it to the center of the counter-binding sigil, and it will call to what was once part of it. Like recognizes like across all barriers, even those between realms."</p> <p>"And this?" Mick had asked, holding up the vial of dark fluid that seemed to absorb rather than reflect the strange lighting of the Crossroads Club.</p> <p>Lilaeth's smile had been unsettling in its genuine amusement. "That, my lonely detective, is your passport. Blackthorn's wards are calibrated to detect and repel supernatural entities. They cannot, however, distinguish between an entity entering physically and one that already exists within human consciousness."</p> <p>"You want me to drink this," Mick had realized, studying the vial with growing apprehension.</p> <p>"Not yet." Lilaeth's voice had carried a warning. "Only when you are ready to enter. Its effects are temporary—three hours at most—and will begin to fade after the first hour. Sufficient time to locate Cell 7B and perform the counter-binding, if you are efficient."</p> <p>"What exactly is in this?"</p> <p>The question had drawn another of those unnervingly perfect smiles. "Something of myself. A fragment of perception that will temporarily alter how reality perceives you. You will experience certain... enhancements. Improved vision in darkness. The ability to see warding sigils and essence traces. A cloaking effect that will render you less noticeable to both human security and metaphysical defenses."</p> <p>"Side effects?" Mick had asked, unable to tear his gaze from the swirling darkness.</p> <p>"The usual when human consciousness brushes against infernal perception," Lilaeth had replied with casual indifference. "Disorientation. Sensory distortion. Perhaps brief hallucinations as your mind processes information it was never designed to interpret." She had leaned closer then, her form momentarily blurring at the edges as if she were partially dissolving into the air around her. "And you will not be alone in your mind. A fragment of my awareness will accompany you—not possession, merely observation. I will see what you see, hear what you hear."</p> <p>Now, sitting in the rain-streaked darkness outside St. Catherine's, Mick turned the vial in his fingers, watching the dark liquid roil against the crystal. Drinking it meant allowing a fragment of Lilaeth into his mind—an intimacy he would never have considered before losing Marchosias. But the alternative was attempting to penetrate a heavily warded facility without supernatural assistance, a suicide mission by any measure.</p> <p>His phone vibrated with a text from Reeves: "Running late. Security detail complication. 30 min minimum."</p> <p>Decision made, Mick pocketed the phone without replying. He wouldn't drag Reeves into this part—if something went wrong with Lilaeth's "passport," better he face those consequences alone.</p> <p>The vial's stopper released with a soft pop that seemed to vibrate at a frequency just beyond normal hearing. The liquid inside grew more agitated, swirling faster as if sensing its impending freedom.</p> <p>"This is probably the stupidest thing I've ever done," Mick said aloud to the empty car. "And that's saying something."</p> <p>He raised the vial in a mock toast to the asylum silhouette against the night sky. "Bottoms up."</p> <p>The liquid didn't so much pour as leap into his mouth, moving with deliberate purpose. It tasted of nothing recognizable—not bitter, not sweet, not anything human taste buds were equipped to process. Instead, it registered as pure sensation—a cascade of information bypassing his senses entirely to download directly into his consciousness.</p> <p>For a terrible moment, nothing happened. Then reality fractured.</p> <p>The world around him shattered into fragments, each piece showing a slightly different version of the same scene, as if viewed through compound eyes. Colors inverted, sound became visible as rippling waves through the air, and the texture of his own skin felt alien beneath his fingertips. Mick gasped, clutching the steering wheel as his perception realigned itself with brutal efficiency.</p> <p><em>"The initial transition is always disorienting for mortals,"</em> a voice observed in his mind. Not Marchosias—this voice was smoother, cooler, distinctly feminine. Lilaeth's presence unfurled within his consciousness like frost spreading across glass. <em>"Your mind will adjust momentarily."</em></p> <p>"Jesus Christ," Mick hissed, squeezing his eyes shut as reality continued to recalibrate around him. When he opened them again, the world had settled into something almost normal, but with crucial differences.</p> <p>The darkness outside now seemed merely dim rather than impenetrable. The asylum building stood revealed in perfect clarity despite the distance and rain, every brick and cornice visible as if illuminated from within. More significantly, he could now see what had been invisible before—a complex network of sigils covering the structure's entire surface, glowing with a pale blue light that oscillated in patterns suggesting a heartbeat.</p> <p><em>"Blackthorn's primary warding system,"</em> Lilaeth commented, her presence a cool weight at the back of his mind. <em>"Quite sophisticated. Multiple layers of protection against various categories of supernatural intrusion. But note the fluctuation patterns—there, along the eastern foundation."</em></p> <p>Mick's attention was drawn to what he now perceived as a rhythmic weakening in the ward's intensity near an old service entrance. The glowing sigils there dimmed momentarily at regular intervals, like a lighthouse with a mechanical flaw in its rotation.</p> <p><em>"Your opportunity,"</em> Lilaeth explained. <em>"A design limitation they couldn't fully eliminate. Essence extraction requires a controlled permeability in the wards—their rigid containment must still allow harvested essence to be transported inside. That permeability creates a predictable vulnerability every 108 seconds."</em></p> <p>Mick exited the car, surprised by how fluid his movements felt—as if his body had been recalibrated along with his perception, each motion more precise and efficient than should have been possible. The rain falling around him was visible as individual droplets, each one refracting light in hypnotic patterns.</p> <p><em>"Don't become distracted by enhanced perception,"</em> Lilaeth warned, her voice now carrying a hint of amusement. <em>"Humans tend to fixate on sensory novelty. Remain focused on your objective."</em></p> <p>The asylum grounds were separated from the street by a tall wrought-iron fence topped with decorative spikes that, under his enhanced vision, revealed themselves to be inscribed with minute warding symbols. Mick approached the fence cautiously, watching the security patterns—two guards patrolling the main entrance, surveillance cameras covering most approaches, but a noticeable gap in coverage near the overgrown eastern perimeter.</p> <p><em>"Curious,"</em> Lilaeth observed as they drew closer to the fence. <em>"They've prioritized supernatural containment over mundane security. How very human to fear the unfamiliar more than the conventional threat."</em></p> <p>Mick found himself moving instinctively toward the gap in the camera coverage, his body responding to tactical assessments that seemed to process faster than conscious thought. The fence, which would normally have presented a significant obstacle, now appeared as merely a temporary inconvenience. He found himself analyzing its structure, identifying the optimal climbing path with a precision that felt entirely natural though he knew it wasn't his own.</p> <p><em>"A minor enhancement to your physical capabilities,"</em> Lilaeth explained, apparently sensing his surprise. <em>"Nothing dramatic—merely optimizing what already exists."</em></p> <p>The climb was effortless, his hands and feet finding purchase with perfect precision. He cleared the top and dropped to the ground on the other side with surprising grace, his body absorbing the impact with none of the jarring he would have expected. The persistent pain in his knee—a souvenir from his police days—was notably absent.</p> <p>On the asylum grounds, the warding sigils were even more visible—a complex, interconnected network that covered every surface like luminescent spiderwebs. Mick could see how they pulsed with energy, stronger in some areas than others, creating a pattern that his enhanced perception automatically began to analyze.</p> <p><em>"The main entrance is heavily protected,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"But the old service tunnels beneath the east wing show significant weakness. Decades of water damage have corrupted the foundation sigils."</em></p> <p>Mick found himself moving toward an overgrown area where concrete had buckled under the pressure of tree roots. What would have been nearly invisible under normal conditions now revealed itself as a narrow access point to the building's basement level. The warding sigils around it flickered inconsistently, like a failing neon sign.</p> <p><em>"Elegant solution,"</em> Lilaeth commented with what sounded like professional admiration. <em>"Using natural degradation as your entry point circumvents their detection triggers."</em></p> <p>The opening was tight but manageable. Mick squeezed through, finding himself in what appeared to be an old maintenance tunnel. Pipes ran along the ceiling, many broken and leaking, creating puddles on the concrete floor that reflected the dim emergency lighting with mirror-like clarity. Under his enhanced vision, the water seemed to capture and hold reflections that shouldn't have been there—faces peering up for an instant before dissolving back into ripples.</p> <p><em>"Ignore the peripheral phenomena,"</em> Lilaeth advised. <em>"Water in thin places often acts as a temporary membrane between states of reality. What you're seeing are merely echo fragments—memories leaked from the containment systems above us."</em></p> <p>The tunnel extended into darkness, but Mick found he could see perfectly well. He moved forward, instinctively avoiding loose debris that might make noise. His awareness of the building's layout seemed to expand with each step, as if he were accessing some kind of subliminal blueprint.</p> <p><em>"You're sensing the essence flow,"</em> Lilaeth explained. <em>"The extraction system creates distinct patterns. Follow the coldest currents—they'll lead you to the most active processing areas."</em></p> <p>Mick realized he could indeed feel temperature variations around him—not physically, but as information being processed on a level beyond normal senses. Certain directions felt "colder" in a way that had nothing to do with actual air temperature. He allowed this new awareness to guide him, turning left at a junction where the metaphysical cold intensified.</p> <p>The tunnel eventually opened into a larger basement area filled with antiquated machinery—old boilers and generators that had once served the original asylum. Here, the warding sigils were more concentrated, covering every surface in pulsing patterns that made his eyes water if he focused on them directly.</p> <p><em>"Interesting,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"They've adapted the original asylum's infrastructure into their containment architecture. Quite efficient—using the building's history of mental suffering as a foundation for consciousness manipulation."</em></p> <p>"That's horrifying," Mick muttered, his voice sounding strange even to his own ears.</p> <p><em>"It's practical,"</em> Lilaeth corrected. <em>"Locations with extensive histories of psychological distress naturally develop certain properties that facilitate essence work. The Victorians built their asylums in thin places, whether they understood that terminology or not."</em></p> <p>A metal staircase led upward, its steps worn by generations of feet. The warding here was particularly intense—sigils that seemed to writhe across the metal surface like living things. Mick hesitated at the bottom, uncertain how to proceed.</p> <p><em>"You're protected by my essence,"</em> Lilaeth reminded him. <em>"The wards will perceive you as neither fully human nor fully supernatural—an ambiguity they're not calibrated to resolve. Move with confidence."</em></p> <p>Mick ascended the stairs, each step sending tremors of wrongness through his enhanced perception. It wasn't pain exactly, more like the mental equivalent of nails on a chalkboard—a sensation that existed at the edge of tolerable. He pushed through it, emerging onto the ground floor of the east wing.</p> <p>The contrast with the basement was jarring. Where the lower level had been abandoned to decay, the first floor had been fully renovated into a modern research facility. Sterile white corridors stretched in both directions, lined with reinforced doors marked with both numbers and symbols. The lighting was soft but pervasive, creating no shadows where one might hide.</p> <p><em>"Clever design,"</em> Lilaeth noted. <em>"The modern renovation disguises the extent of their operation. Conventional security would see merely a research wing. Only those with enhanced perception would recognize the containment architecture integrated into the walls themselves."</em></p> <p>The corridor was empty, but Mick could hear movement elsewhere in the building—the rhythmic footsteps of security patrols, the occasional murmur of voices from behind closed doors. With his enhanced hearing, these sounds mapped themselves in his mind, creating a three-dimensional awareness of human presence throughout the facility.</p> <p>"Where's Cell 7B?" he whispered, conscious of how sound might carry.</p> <p><em>"Upper level,"</em> Lilaeth replied. <em>"Follow the essence flow—it all channels upward to a central point."</em></p> <p>Mick concentrated on his new senses, feeling for the "cold" current Lilaeth had mentioned. After a moment, he detected it—a directional pull that seemed to originate from somewhere above. He moved toward a stairwell at the end of the corridor, his footsteps unnaturally silent due to whatever enhancements Lilaeth's essence had granted him.</p> <p>The stairwell was utilitarian and unmarked, but under his enhanced vision, Mick could see that the walls were covered with more of the pulsing sigils—these arranged in vertical patterns that suggested channeling or containment. As he climbed, the air grew noticeably heavier, as if the oxygen itself carried greater density.</p> <p><em>"Essence concentration increases with proximity to the primary extraction node,"</em> Lilaeth explained. <em>"What you're experiencing is reality thickening as multiple states of existence overlap."</em></p> <p>The second floor continued the sterile research aesthetic, but with subtle differences. The doors here were heavier, with more sophisticated electronic locks and additional warding sigils barely visible beneath the paint. The corridor curved gently, following what Mick now understood was the original asylum's circular design—a surveillance feature that allowed attendants to observe all rooms from a central nursing station.</p> <p>In the renovated version, that central station had been transformed into a high-tech monitoring hub. Through the reinforced glass, Mick could see banks of screens displaying various rooms—some showing conventional medical monitoring equipment, others displaying data patterns he couldn't interpret. A single technician sat at the controls, her attention focused on a screen showing what appeared to be flowing waveforms.</p> <p><em>"Essence monitoring,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"They're tracking flow rates through the containment system. Quite sophisticated for human technology."</em></p> <p>Mick pressed himself against the wall, calculating sight lines and patrol patterns. With his enhanced perception, he could identify the regular rhythm of security movements throughout the floor—a guard passing through the far corridor every twelve minutes, another checking the monitoring hub every twenty.</p> <p>"How do I get past the hub?" he whispered.</p> <p><em>"You don't need to,"</em> Lilaeth replied. <em>"The primary extraction node isn't on this floor. Continue upward."</em></p> <p>Another stairwell at the opposite end of the corridor led to the third floor. As Mick ascended, the ambient temperature dropped noticeably, his breath becoming visible despite the climate-controlled environment. The warding sigils grew more concentrated, no longer just covering the walls but seeming to flow through the very structure of the building itself.</p> <p>The third floor was dramatically different from those below. Here, the modern renovation gave way to the original asylum architecture—high ceilings, ornate moldings, wide corridors with arched doorways. Unlike the abandoned appearance from outside, this floor was clearly in active use, but maintained in its historical condition rather than modernized.</p> <p><em>"Fascinating,"</em> Lilaeth commented, her presence in Mick's mind shifting slightly as if leaning forward with interest. <em>"They've preserved the original architecture because it forms part of their containment system. These Victorian designs incorporated unconscious geometries that naturally affect consciousness."</em></p> <p>The corridor stretched before him, doors labeled with brass plates bearing only numbers. Unlike the electronic security below, these featured heavy mechanical locks that appeared original to the building but were clearly well-maintained. The warding sigils here were different as well—more elaborate, more densely packed, creating patterns that made Mick's enhanced vision blur if he tried to follow them directly.</p> <p>"Which one is 7B?" Mick asked, his voice barely audible even to his own enhanced hearing.</p> <p><em>"Follow the convergence,"</em> Lilaeth instructed. <em>"All essence flow channels toward a single point."</em></p> <p>Mick concentrated, feeling for the directional "cold" that had guided him so far. It was stronger here, pulling him forward with almost physical force. He moved down the corridor, passing doors marked 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, the sensation intensifying with each step.</p> <p>The corridor ended at a circular area with doors arranged like spokes on a wheel. At the center of this hub was a heavy security door marked simply "7" with no letter designation. Unlike the historical fixtures elsewhere on the floor, this featured modern security—a keycard reader, numerical keypad, and what appeared to be a biometric scanner.</p> <p><em>"Clever misdirection,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"Cell 7B isn't a room on the spoke—it's beneath this central hub. The entire circular design channels into a space directly below."</em></p> <p>"How do I access it?"</p> <p><em>"The maintenance access,"</em> Lilaeth replied, directing his attention to what appeared to be a utility closet adjacent to the security door. <em>"Victorian asylums required regular access to their central surveillance hubs. Modern security focuses on the main entrance while overlooking historical features."</em></p> <p>The utility closet was locked with a simple mechanical system that posed no challenge to someone with Mick's background. Within seconds, he had it open and was slipping inside, pulling the door closed behind him. The small space contained cleaning supplies and maintenance equipment, but at the back, partially hidden behind shelving, was another door—this one made of aged wood with iron banding.</p> <p><em>"The original access point,"</em> Lilaeth confirmed. <em>"It will bypass their modern security entirely."</em></p> <p>The old door creaked slightly as Mick eased it open, revealing a narrow spiral staircase descending into darkness. Unlike the functional modern stairs elsewhere in the building, this was ornate wrought iron, its railings twisted into patterns that, under his enhanced vision, revealed themselves as subtle warding sigils incorporated into the decorative elements.</p> <p><em>"Remarkable craftsmanship,"</em> Lilaeth commented. <em>"The Victorians understood certain principles intuitively, encoding them into architecture without conscious knowledge of their function."</em></p> <p>The staircase circled downward for what seemed like too many rotations to remain within the building's dimensions. Mick's enhanced perception confirmed what he already suspected—this space existed partially outside conventional geometry, the descent taking him not just physically downward but across some threshold of reality itself.</p> <p>At the bottom, a short corridor ended at a simple door marked "7B" in faded paint. Unlike the sophisticated security above, this entrance featured only a heavy iron lock that appeared original to the building. The door itself pulsed with warding sigils more concentrated than any Mick had seen so far—layers upon layers of protection that made the air around it visibly distort.</p> <p><em>"The primary extraction node,"</em> Lilaeth said, her voice carrying a note of what might have been respect. <em>"The anchor point for their entire containment system. Blackwood was clever—hiding it beneath layers of misdirection, using the original architecture as both camouflage and reinforcement."</em></p> <p>Mick approached cautiously, feeling intense pressure building around him as he neared the door. The lock, despite its ancient appearance, would normally have presented a challenge to his picking skills, but with his enhanced perception, he could visualize its internal mechanism with perfect clarity. Within moments, the lock yielded with a heavy click that seemed to resonate at frequencies beyond normal hearing.</p> <p>The door swung inward, revealing a chamber that defied expectation. While the upper floors had alternated between modern research facility and preserved Victorian architecture, Cell 7B was something else entirely—a perfect circular room with walls of bare stone that appeared far older than the building above. The ceiling was domed and covered with intricate carvings that Mick's enhanced vision recognized as sigils of extraordinary complexity, arranged in concentric circles that all centered on a single point directly above the middle of the room.</p> <p>The floor featured a similar pattern carved into stone, creating a perfect reflection of the ceiling design. Between these two planes of sigils, the air itself seemed to vibrate with visible current—essence flowing in precise geometric patterns that connected floor to ceiling, forming a three-dimensional construct of pure energy.</p> <p>At the room's center stood a single chair—not the modern medical equipment Mick had expected, but a heavy wooden structure with restraints that appeared to be original asylum equipment. The chair was positioned on a raised dais precisely aligned with the central point of both floor and ceiling sigils. The wood was dark with age and what might have been bloodstains, the leather restraints cracked but still functional.</p> <p><em>"The original extraction point,"</em> Lilaeth explained, her presence in Mick's mind shifting with what felt like increased attention. <em>"Blackwood didn't build this system—he discovered it. The Victorians created it, perhaps unwittingly, and he merely adapted it for his specific purposes."</em></p> <p>Mick stepped fully into the room, closing the door behind him. The moment the latch clicked, the ambient sound from the building above vanished completely. The silence was absolute, pressing against his eardrums like a physical force. Within this silence, he could hear something else—a faint, rhythmic pulsing that seemed to come from the walls themselves, like a massive heart beating just beyond perception.</p> <p><em>"The binding anchor,"</em> Lilaeth said, indicating the intricate patterns carved into the floor and ceiling. <em>"The nexus point that connects their entire extraction network. All essence they've harvested flows through here, all bindings are anchored to these sigils."</em></p> <p>Mick moved to the center of the room, careful not to disturb the patterns of energy he could now perceive flowing through the air around him. He removed the laminated drawings from his pocket—Eliza's crayon creations that somehow perfectly replicated counter-binding sigils despite being created by a toddler. Alongside them, he produced the small velvet pouch containing Marchosias's feather, which seemed to pulse with its own inner light even through the fabric.</p> <p><em>"Remarkable,"</em> Lilaeth observed as Mick spread Eliza's drawings on the floor, arranging them in the sequence that matched the central floor sigil. <em>"The child has reproduced the counter-binding perfectly. Her connection to the Infernal Realm must be far stronger than anticipated."</em></p> <p>"Will it work?" Mick asked, his voice sounding strange in the absolute silence of the chamber.</p> <p><em>"It should create a targeted disruption,"</em> Lilaeth replied. <em>"Breaking the specific binding that holds Marchosias without compromising the entire containment system. But you must be precise in your placement."</em></p> <p>Mick carefully positioned the drawings, aligning them with the carved patterns beneath. The central drawing—the one featuring concentric circles around an empty space—he placed directly in the middle of the floor sigil. As soon as the paper made contact with the stone, the crayon markings began to glow with the same ethereal light as the carved sigils surrounding them.</p> <p><em>"Now the feather,"</em> Lilaeth instructed. <em>"Place it at the exact center of the drawing. It will serve as both key and beacon, calling to what once was part of the same whole."</em></p> <p>Mick opened the velvet pouch, carefully extracting the feather. Under his enhanced vision, it was even more impossible than he remembered—not just iridescent but seemingly existing in multiple states simultaneously, its edges blurring into frequencies his eyes shouldn't be able to perceive. It hummed against his fingertips with a vibration that traveled up his arm and resonated in his chest.</p> <p>With ceremonial precision, he placed the feather at the center of Eliza's drawing. The moment it made contact, a reaction rippled through the room. The carved sigils flared with sudden intensity, their light pulsing in patterns that suggested agitation. The humming in the walls increased in both volume and frequency, the stone itself seeming to vibrate with tension.</p> <p><em>"The counter-binding is activating,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"It's creating a disruption in the containment field, a targeted breach that should—"</em></p> <p>She was interrupted by a sudden shift in the room's energy. The flowing patterns Mick had perceived in the air began to destabilize, forming eddies and whirlpools of essence that spun with increasing speed. The feather at the center of the drawing rose slightly, hovering an inch above the paper, rotating slowly as if seeking something.</p> <p><em>"Fascinating,"</em> Lilaeth commented. <em>"The feather retains a connection to its source across all barriers. It's trying to locate Marchosias within the Labyrinth realm."</em></p> <p>The temperature in the room plummeted, frost forming on the stone surfaces despite the previous warmth. Mick's breath clouded before him in thick white plumes that hung in the air longer than they should have. The feather's rotation increased, becoming a blur of iridescent color that seemed to tear at the fabric of reality around it.</p> <p>Then, abruptly, it stopped—pointing with unnatural precision toward a specific section of the wall. As Mick watched, that section of stone began to darken, as if being consumed from within by some impossible shadow. The darkness spread, forming a roughly oval shape approximately the size of a doorway.</p> <p><em>"A bridge,"</em> Lilaeth explained, her voice carrying an edge of excitement that felt distinctly unprofessional compared to her previous clinical tone. <em>"The counter-binding is creating a direct connection to the Labyrinth realm. Quite extraordinary for human-implemented metaphysics."</em></p> <p>The darkness solidified into what appeared to be a portal—not merely an absence of light but a presence of something else, a window into a space that couldn't be described in normal geometric terms. Through this opening, Mick could see glimpses of impossible architecture—corridors that bent at angles that shouldn't exist, staircases that led both up and down simultaneously, doorways opening onto the same room from different perspectives.</p> <p><em>"The Labyrinth,"</em> Lilaeth confirmed. <em>"Exactly as I described it—a realm of pure connection, neither fully material nor infernal. This is where consciousness goes when severed from its anchor but preserved within the connective tissue of reality itself."</em></p> <p>Mick approached the portal cautiously. "Now what?"</p> <p><em>"You must enter,"</em> Lilaeth said simply. <em>"The counter-binding has created the path, but only you can walk it. Marchosias will be somewhere within—drawn toward the feather's resonance but unable to cross the threshold without assistance."</em></p> <p>"I have to go in there?" Mick asked, staring into the geometric impossibility beyond the portal with growing apprehension.</p> <p><em>"The only way to retrieve what was lost,"</em> Lilaeth confirmed. <em>"Remember, paths run in both directions. What you find may not be precisely what you lost. The Labyrinth changes things, as all journeys do."</em></p> <p>Mick steadied himself, focusing on the persistent emptiness in his mind where Marchosias should be. After five weeks of separation, the void had become almost unbearable—a constant, aching absence that made even basic functioning a struggle. Whatever risks the Labyrinth posed, they paled in comparison to continuing in this half-existence.</p> <p>"How long will the portal remain stable?" he asked, removing his jacket and setting it aside. Whatever lay beyond would likely require unencumbered movement.</p> <p><em>"Not long,"</em> Lilaeth warned. <em>"Minutes at most. The counter-binding wasn't designed for prolonged activation. You must enter, find Marchosias, and return before the connection collapses."</em></p> <p>"And if I'm still inside when it closes?"</p> <p><em>"Then both of you will remain in the Labyrinth,"</em> she replied with clinical detachment. <em>"Consciousness without anchor, adrift in the space between realms. Neither living nor dead, simply... lost."</em></p> <p>Mick took a deep breath, steadying himself. "Well, when you put it that way, how could I resist?"</p> <p>He approached the portal, feeling reality distort around him as he neared its threshold. At the very edge, he hesitated, looking back at the cell's arched doorway—his only exit if something went wrong.</p> <p>"No matter what happens," he said, addressing Lilaeth's presence in his mind, "if I don't make it back, make sure Reeves knows what happened. She deserves that much."</p> <p><em>"I will convey your fate,"</em> Lilaeth agreed. <em>"Though I expect such dramatics to be unnecessary. You've come too far to fail now, detective."</em></p> <p>With a final steadying breath, Mick stepped through the portal and into the Labyrinth.</p> <p>The transition was instantly disorienting. Normal physics ceased to apply as gravity became merely a suggestion rather than a law. Mick found himself walking on what appeared to be both floor and ceiling simultaneously, the perspective shifting depending on where he focused his attention. Corridors extended in impossible directions, branching and reconnecting in patterns that defied Euclidean geometry.</p> <p><em>"Fascinating,"</em> Lilaeth commented, her presence in his mind somehow sharper here, more distinct. <em>"The Labyrinth manifests differently for each consciousness that enters it. What you're seeing is your mind's attempt to render intelligible a realm that exists beyond conventional perception."</em></p> <p>The architecture around him seemed vaguely familiar—elements resembling the asylum's Victorian design mixed with fragments of other places Mick recognized: his flat, Reeves's office, the Crossroads Club, all distorted and recombined in impossible configurations. Doorways opened onto the same room from different angles, stairways led both upward and downward depending on the direction of approach.</p> <p>"How do I find Marchosias in this?" Mick asked, his voice sounding strange—as if speaking underwater while simultaneously standing in an echo chamber.</p> <p><em>"Focus on your connection,"</em> Lilaeth instructed. <em>"Even severed, some echo of your bond remains—like a phantom limb. Concentrate on that sensation, and the Labyrinth will respond."</em></p> <p>Mick closed his eyes, which seemed counterintuitive while navigating an impossible space, but somehow felt right. He focused on the emptiness in his mind, the void where Marchosias should be, reaching out toward it not with his senses but with something more fundamental—the part of his consciousness that had learned to coexist with another being.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, the Labyrinth had shifted. The chaotic architecture had reconfigured, corridors now aligning toward a central point that pulsed with familiar darkness. The path forward wasn't straight, still winding through impossible turns and perspective shifts, but the direction was clear.</p> <p>Mick moved with purpose, navigating the twisting passages with increasing confidence. As he progressed deeper, he began to notice other presences in the peripheral spaces—shadowy entities that flowed through adjoining corridors or watched from doorways that opened onto voids. Some appeared vaguely humanoid, others completely alien in form, all of them seemingly trapped in their own versions of the same maze.</p> <p><em>"Other bindings,"</em> Lilaeth explained, her voice carrying a note of professional curiosity. <em>"Consciousnesses extracted and contained by Blackthorn's operations. Each exists in its own interpretation of the Labyrinth, occasionally intersecting where the barriers between individual perceptions thin."</em></p> <p>"They're all trapped here?" Mick asked, disturbed by the implications.</p> <p><em>"Indeed. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of consciousnesses—some demonic, some human, some something else entirely. A veritable collection of awareness, all suspended in this transitional state."</em></p> <p>The realization made Mick's skin crawl. Blackthorn wasn't just experimenting with essence extraction—they were imprisoning consciousness itself, creating a metaphysical prison population that existed beyond any legal or ethical oversight.</p> <p>As he pressed forward, the path narrowed, the architecture becoming more constrained and deliberate. The random elements faded, replaced by a recurring motif that Mick recognized from his dreams—a corridor that bent at impossible angles, doorways that opened to reveal the same room from different perspectives, walls that seemed to breathe when not observed directly.</p> <p><em>"You're nearing the center of your particular Labyrinth manifestation,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"The space where your connection to Marchosias is strongest. He should be here, drawn by both your presence and the feather's resonance."</em></p> <p>The corridor ended at a familiar door—the entrance to Mick's own flat, rendered with perfect detail down to the scratch on the lower panel from where he'd once kicked it open while drunk. But unlike the real thing, this door radiated darkness—not the absence of light but something more fundamental, a void-like presence that seemed to consume the reality around it.</p> <p><em>"He's here,"</em> Lilaeth confirmed, her voice suddenly hushed. <em>"Or what remains of him after weeks in the Labyrinth. Remember my warning—what you find may not be precisely what you lost."</em></p> <p>Mick reached for the door handle, the metal ice-cold against his skin. "What does that mean, exactly?"</p> <p><em>"The Labyrinth affects consciousness in unpredictable ways,"</em> Lilaeth replied. <em>"Isolation, distortion, fragmentation. Time passes differently here. What has been weeks for you might have been centuries for him—or mere moments. There's no way to know until you see."</em></p> <p>The door swung open, revealing not Mick's flat but a vast, impossible space that shouldn't have fit behind any door. It resembled an amphitheater of shadow, circular tiers descending toward a central point where darkness gathered with such density it seemed to bend light around itself. The air here felt thick, resistant, as if reality itself were struggling to maintain coherence against some fundamental contradiction.</p> <p>At the center of this void stood a figure Mick recognized despite its altered state—Marchosias, but not as he had appeared during their shared consciousness. This manifestation was more primal, more elemental—a being of shadow and flame, wings of darkness extending from a form that shifted between lupine and serpentine aspects. Above the creature's head, a corona of fire burned without consuming, casting no light but somehow illuminating the void around it.</p> <p><em>"Fascinating,"</em> Lilaeth breathed, her presence in Mick's mind shifting forward with increased attention. <em>"His true form, undiluted by the constraints of shared consciousness. Magnificent even after all this time."</em></p> <p>The entity that was Marchosias turned toward them, and Mick felt recognition flare—not through normal senses but as a resonance deep within his own consciousness, like a tuning fork finding its matching frequency. The void eyes that met his held no human expression, yet Mick could feel the shock, the disbelief, and beneath it all, a desperate hope.</p> <p>"Marchosias?" Mick called, his voice sounding flat and inadequate in this space of pure consciousness.</p> <p>The entity responded not with words but with a surge of presence that washed over Mick like a tidal wave of cold fire. Images flooded his mind—memories, emotions, fragments of experience too alien to fully comprehend. It was not language but pure communication, direct and overwhelming.</p> <p><em>Mick/self/host/partner/found/impossible/here/how/trapped/endless/alone/searching</em></p> <p>The thoughts weren't organized into sentences but existed as concentrated bursts of meaning, each containing layers of context and emotion beyond what words could convey. Beneath them ran a current of desperate relief so intense it manifested as physical sensation—a constriction in Mick's chest that made breathing difficult.</p> <p>"I came to bring you back," Mick said, advancing into the amphitheater of shadow. "There's a way out—a counter-binding. But we don't have much time."</p> <p>The entity shifted, its form rippling with what might have been agitation. More concepts flooded Mick's mind:</p> <p><em>Time/meaningless/here/endless/corridors/searching/lost/fragments/dissolution/holding/barely</em></p> <p><em>"He's struggling to maintain coherence,"</em> Lilaeth explained, her usual clinical detachment returning. <em>"The Labyrinth fragments consciousness over time. He's been fighting to preserve his identity against constant dissolution."</em></p> <p>"How do I help him?" Mick asked, continuing to approach the central void where Marchosias hovered between states of being.</p> <p><em>"You must reconnect,"</em> Lilaeth replied. <em>"The bond that was severed must be restored, even temporarily, to guide him back through the portal."</em></p> <p>As Mick reached the center of the amphitheater, standing directly before the shifting entity that was Marchosias, he could feel the resistance between them—like magnets oriented to repel rather than attract. The binding that had separated them still existed, even here in the Labyrinth, preventing direct reconnection.</p> <p><em>"Physical contact,"</em> Lilaeth instructed. <em>"In this realm of pure consciousness, the symbolic carries literal power. A deliberate joining of separate entities will bypass the binding's restrictions."</em></p> <p>Mick reached out his hand toward the void-like heart of the shifting form. "Marchosias," he said, focusing all his intent into the name. "Come home."</p> <p>The entity hesitated, its form rippling with uncertainty. Another flood of concepts washed through Mick's mind:</p> <p><em>Changed/different/not-same/both/altered/binding/pain/risk/dissolution</em></p> <p>"I know," Mick acknowledged. "We're both different now. But we can figure that out together, not trapped in separate realms."</p> <p>He took another step forward, hand still extended. "Five weeks without you has been hell enough. I'm not leaving here alone."</p> <p>The void shifted, condensing into something more defined, more focused. Wings of shadow folded inward as the entity approached Mick's outstretched hand with deliberate caution. When they finally made contact, reality seemed to fracture around them.</p> <p>The sensation was beyond pain, beyond pleasure—a fundamental realignment of consciousness that felt like being torn apart and reconstructed simultaneously. Mick's perception splintered, expanded, then collapsed back into a singularity where two separate awarenesses suddenly occupied the same metaphysical space.</p> <p><em>"Mick?"</em> The voice in his mind was familiar but strange, layered with harmonics he'd never heard before, carrying echoes of experiences beyond human comprehension. <em>"Is this real?"</em></p> <p>"It's real," Mick confirmed, his own voice sounding distant and muffled against the roar of reconnection. "But we need to go. Now. The portal won't stay open much longer."</p> <p>The entity that was Marchosias flowed around him, through him, not fully reintegrating but creating a temporary connection that allowed shared navigation. Mick felt his perception expand dramatically as Marchosias's awareness merged partially with his own, revealing aspects of the Labyrinth that had been invisible before.</p> <p>With this enhanced perspective, the path back to the portal became immediately clear—not the winding maze Mick had navigated on his way in, but a direct route that cut through the Labyrinth's deceptions like a blade through illusion.</p> <p><em>"This way,"</em> Marchosias guided, his presence flowing around Mick like a current. <em>"Quickly—the connection destabilizes."</em></p> <p>Together they moved through the Labyrinth, space bending around them as reality struggled to accommodate their partially merged state. The shadowy entities Mick had glimpsed earlier now revealed themselves more fully—consciousnesses trapped in their own versions of the maze, some reaching out in desperate recognition as Marchosias passed, others recoiling in fear or hatred.</p> <p><em>"So many,"</em> Marchosias observed, his thoughts carrying layers of horror and recognition. <em>"Blackthorn has been busy. These aren't just demons—there are human consciousnesses here too. Fragments of essence extracted and abandoned."</em></p> <p>"We'll deal with that later," Mick insisted, focusing on the path ahead. "First, we get out."</p> <p>As they approached the portal, it became clear that something was wrong. The opening was shrinking, its edges creeping inward like ice forming on a pond. Beyond it, Cell 7B was visible—the counter-binding sigils still glowing on the floor, but with diminishing intensity.</p> <p><em>"The connection weakens,"</em> Marchosias observed, his presence pulsing with sudden urgency. <em>"The counter-binding wasn't designed for prolonged activation."</em></p> <p><em>"You must hurry,"</em> Lilaeth added, her voice cutting through their shared consciousness with surprising clarity. <em>"The portal collapses. Another minute at most."</em></p> <p>They accelerated toward the narrowing opening, space warping around them as Marchosias's influence bent the Labyrinth's architecture to speed their passage. As they reached the threshold, Mick felt resistance building—the binding that had separated them reasserting itself as they approached the material realm.</p> <p><em>"It's fighting us,"</em> Marchosias observed, his presence stuttering against the building pressure. <em>"The original binding recognizes me, tries to prevent return."</em></p> <p>"Not happening," Mick growled, pushing forward with renewed determination. "We go together or not at all."</p> <p>With a final surge of effort, they crossed the threshold just as the portal contracted to the size of a pinhole. The transition back to physical reality was brutal—a compression of consciousness that felt like being forced through a space too small to contain them. Mick's enhanced perception overloaded with sensory input, his mind struggling to process the sudden shift from metaphysical to material existence.</p> <p>He collapsed to the floor of Cell 7B, gasping as his lungs remembered how to function in conventional reality. The counter-binding sigils beneath him were fading, Eliza's drawings now charred around the edges as if subjected to extreme heat. Marchosias's feather had disintegrated entirely, leaving only a fine dust that glittered with impossible colors.</p> <p>For one terrible moment, Mick felt nothing in his mind but his own thoughts, and fear gripped him that they had failed—that Marchosias had been left behind, lost in the collapsing portal. Then, gradually, he became aware of another presence unfurling within his consciousness—familiar yet changed, like music played in a different key than remembered.</p> <p><em>"That,"</em> Marchosias finally said, his mental voice carrying both exhaustion and wonder, <em>"was extraordinarily unpleasant."</em></p> <p>Relief washed through Mick with such intensity that he laughed aloud, the sound echoing strangely in the circular chamber. "Five weeks of silence, and that's the first thing you say to me?"</p> <p><em>"Would you prefer a heartfelt monologue about the existential horror of consciousness fragmentation?"</em> The sardonic tone was pure Marchosias, though layered with something new—a depth that hadn't been there before, echoes of experiences Mick couldn't begin to comprehend.</p> <p>Before Mick could respond, Lilaeth's presence reasserted itself in his mind—a cool interruption to their reunion. <em>"Touching as this is, I feel compelled to remind you that you remain in the heart of a heavily warded facility dedicated to capturing and containing entities exactly like the one you've just rescued. Perhaps celebrations could wait until you've completed your escape?"</em></p> <p>She was right, of course. Already Mick could feel the room's energy shifting, the patterns of essence flow destabilizing as the system registered the disruption. Somewhere in the building, alarms would be triggering, security protocols activating in response to the breach.</p> <p>"Time to go," Mick agreed, struggling to his feet. He gathered Eliza's charred drawings, tucking them back into his pocket. "Can you tell what's happening outside?"</p> <p><em>"Security protocols activated on the upper levels,"</em> Marchosias confirmed, his perception extending beyond the confines of the room. <em>"They don't yet know exactly what's happened, but they've detected the disruption in the containment system."</em></p> <p><em>"Your enhanced perception will begin to fade soon,"</em> Lilaeth added. <em>"My essence sustains it temporarily, but the effect diminishes with usage. Perhaps thirty minutes remaining before you return to purely human capabilities."</em></p> <p>Mick moved quickly to the door, listening for movement in the corridor beyond. "The way we came in should still be clear. If we can reach the maintenance tunnels before they lock down the building, we have a chance."</p> <p><em>"A reasonable plan,"</em> Marchosias agreed, his presence settling more fully into Mick's consciousness with each passing moment. <em>"Though I notice your strategies haven't become any less reckless during our separation."</em></p> <p>"I came for you, didn't I?" Mick countered, easing the door open and checking the corridor. "I'd say that worked out pretty well."</p> <p><em>"A matter of perspective,"</em> Marchosias replied. <em>"Though I admit, the alternative was becoming increasingly problematic."</em></p> <p>As they slipped into the corridor, Mick felt a moment of disorientation as multiple perspectives briefly overlapped—his own physical senses, Marchosias's metaphysical perception, and the lingering enhancement from Lilaeth's essence all processing the same environment in dramatically different ways.</p> <p><em>"Fascinating,"</em> Lilaeth observed. <em>"The reintegration creates interesting perceptual harmonics. A shared consciousness with three distinct frequencies."</em></p> <p><em>"Temporary frequencies,"</em> Marchosias corrected, his tone carrying unmistakable territorial warning. <em>"Your invitation has a very specific expiration."</em></p> <p><em>"Of course,"</em> Lilaeth replied, amusement evident in her mental voice. <em>"I merely observe what is already evident—the detective's consciousness has developed interesting accommodations through extended exposure to non-human perception."</em></p> <p>Mick ignored their exchange, focusing on navigating back toward the spiral staircase. His enhanced senses still functioned, allowing him to perceive the movement of security personnel on the floors above. They were organizing search patterns, systematically checking each section of the building, but hadn't yet identified the true location of the disturbance.</p> <p>The spiral staircase took them back to the utility closet, which Mick exited cautiously after confirming the hub area remained clear. The third floor corridor stretched before them, shadows deepening as emergency protocols reduced lighting to minimum levels.</p> <p><em>"Two security personnel approaching from the east wing,"</em> Marchosias warned, his perception extending well beyond normal human range. <em>"Moving quickly—they've identified this floor as the epicenter of the disruption."</em></p> <p>"Can you do anything?" Mick asked, remembering the supernatural abilities he'd grown accustomed to during their partnership.</p> <p><em>"Not yet,"</em> Marchosias replied, frustration evident in his mental voice. <em>"The reintegration remains incomplete. I can perceive but not influence."</em></p> <p><em>"Your passenger requires time to fully settle,"</em> Lilaeth explained. <em>"The Labyrinth altered certain fundamental frequencies. Harmonization will occur naturally, but not immediately."</em></p> <p>Mick adjusted his approach, relying on the enhanced perception provided by Lilaeth's essence rather than Marchosias's abilities. He moved quickly but carefully toward the stairwell that would take them to the lower floors, using his temporarily heightened senses to avoid the approaching security team.</p> <p>The descent through the building became a tense exercise in strategic movement. Security personnel were mobilizing on all floors now, their patterns becoming more organized as they identified the center of the disturbance. Twice Mick was forced to duck into side rooms to avoid detection, relying on his enhanced perception to time his movements precisely.</p> <p><em>"Impressive adaptation,"</em> Marchosias observed as they successfully navigated past a security checkpoint. <em>"Your capabilities have developed in my absence."</em></p> <p>"Necessity," Mick replied tersely. "It's amazing how quickly you learn to compensate when half your perception is suddenly missing."</p> <p>They reached the ground floor without incident, but the final obstacle remained—crossing the modern research wing to reach the basement access that would lead to the maintenance tunnels. Here, security was heaviest, with armed personnel establishing a perimeter around the building's core.</p> <p><em>"The loading dock,"</em> Marchosias suggested, directing Mick's attention to a service area at the far end of the corridor. <em>"Less coverage, direct access to the exterior."</em></p> <p>With no better options, Mick moved in that direction, using the enhanced perception to time his movements between security patrols. The loading dock was secured but less heavily guarded, with only a single officer monitoring the exit.</p> <p><em>"Your enhanced capabilities are fading,"</em> Lilaeth warned as Mick approached the final corridor. <em>"The essence dilutes with use."</em></p> <p>She was right—the edges of his perception were beginning to blur, colors losing their hyper-real quality, sounds returning to their normal range. Whatever temporary power Lilaeth's essence had granted was diminishing rapidly.</p> <p><em>"We need a distraction,"</em> Marchosias observed, his presence in Mick's mind growing stronger even as the enhanced perception weakened. <em>"And I believe I can finally provide one."</em></p> <p>Before Mick could ask what he meant, Marchosias's presence surged forward, not taking control but extending outward in a way that felt new—more controlled, more precise than before their separation. The shadows around them deepened, condensing into shapes that resembled the hounds Marchosias had manifested in the past, but with subtle differences—these were more defined, more substantial despite being formed of pure darkness.</p> <p><em>"The Labyrinth taught me certain refinements,"</em> Marchosias explained, a note of grim satisfaction in his mental voice. <em>"Distillation through isolation has its benefits."</em></p> <p>The shadow constructs moved with deliberate purpose, flowing away from Mick toward the opposite end of the corridor. There, they suddenly expanded, taking on more substantial form before releasing a harmonized howl that sounded impossibly like a distant alarm.</p> <p>The effect was immediate. The guard at the loading dock responded to the sound, moving away from his post to investigate. As other security personnel converged on the distraction, Mick slipped forward, using the last of his enhanced perception to navigate the now-unguarded exit.</p> <p>The loading dock opened onto a service yard surrounded by a chain-link fence. With the last vestiges of Lilaeth's enhancement, Mick scaled it easily, dropping to the ground outside the facility's perimeter just as alarms began blaring throughout the building—no longer just the shadow hounds' mimicry but actual security protocols activating in full force.</p> <p><em>"Well executed,"</em> Lilaeth commented as they moved quickly away from the building, her presence in Mick's mind already beginning to fade. <em>"My part in this arrangement concludes. You've successfully retrieved your demon and escaped Blackthorn's facility—no small achievement for a human, even one with temporary enhancements."</em></p> <p><em>"Your assistance was... adequate,"</em> Marchosias acknowledged reluctantly. <em>"Though your motivations remain suspect."</em></p> <p><em>"My motivations are precisely what I stated,"</em> Lilaeth replied, her mental voice growing distant. <em>"Blackthorn's activities threaten the metaphysical ecosystem. Their industrialized approach to essence harvesting creates imbalances that affect all realms."</em></p> <p>She directed her final thoughts toward Mick specifically. <em>"Remember our arrangement, detective. Three drops of blood freely given, and an open favor to be claimed at my discretion. I will collect when the time is right."</em></p> <p>With that, her presence dissipated completely, leaving only Mick and Marchosias in the shared consciousness that now felt both familiar and somehow altered—like returning to a home where furniture had been subtly rearranged during one's absence.</p> <p><em>"An open favor to Lilaeth,"</em> Marchosias observed, something like apprehension coloring his mental voice. <em>"You certainly didn't waste time making dangerous arrangements during my absence."</em></p> <p>"It worked, didn't it?" Mick replied, continuing to put distance between themselves and St. Catherine's. "Besides, it's my favor, not yours. She was very specific about that."</p> <p><em>"A distinction that may prove significant,"</em> Marchosias acknowledged. <em>"Though not necessarily in our favor."</em></p> <p>They reached the street where Mick had left his car, slipping inside just as the wail of approaching police sirens cut through the night. The facility's security breach had escalated to external response, though they were looking for intruders attempting to exit the facility, not someone already safely away.</p> <p>As Mick started the engine and pulled away from the curb, he felt Marchosias settling more completely into their shared consciousness—not the invasive presence of their early days together, but something more balanced, more integrated than even before their separation.</p> <p><em>"The Labyrinth changes things,"</em> Marchosias said, echoing Lilaeth's earlier warning. <em>"My experience there was... extensive."</em></p> <p>"You want to talk about it?" Mick asked, genuinely curious about what had happened during their separation.</p> <p><em>"Not yet,"</em> Marchosias replied. <em>"First, I believe we have unfinished business with Blackthorn. They've been quite busy during our separation."</em></p> <p>"One crisis at a time," Mick agreed, directing the car toward Reeves's flat where she would undoubtedly be waiting with equal parts relief and fury. "First, we need to update Reeves on what we've learned. Then we figure out our next move against Blackthorn."</p> <p>As they drove through the darkened London streets, Mick felt a sense of completion he hadn't experienced in weeks. The void in his mind was filled once more, the silence replaced by the familiar presence that had somehow become essential to his existence.</p> <p>Whatever challenges lay ahead—Blackthorn's operations, the Aggregation project, Lilaeth's eventual claim on her favor—they would face them together, altered by their separation but ultimately stronger for having overcome it.</p> <p><em>"It's good to be back,"</em> Marchosias said simply, his presence settling into the familiar corners of their shared consciousness.</p> <p>"Don't get sentimental on me now," Mick replied with a smile that felt genuine for the first time in weeks. "We've got work to do."</p> <p></p> </article> </div> <script>var target=document.getElementById(location.hash.slice(1));target&&target.name&&(target.checked=target.name.startsWith("__tabbed_"))</script> </div> <button type=button class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8z"/></svg> Back to top </button> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <nav class="md-footer__inner md-grid" aria-label=Footer> <a href=Scene%3A%20Old%20Debts.html class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--prev" aria-label="Previous: Scene: Old Debts"> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 11v2H8l5.5 5.5-1.42 1.42L4.16 12l7.92-7.92L13.5 5.5 8 11z"/></svg> </div> <div class=md-footer__title> <span class=md-footer__direction> Previous </span> <div class=md-ellipsis> Scene: Old Debts </div> </div> </a> <a href=Scene%3A%20The%20Blackthorn%20Web.html class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--next" aria-label="Next: Scene: The Blackthorn Web"> <div class=md-footer__title> <span class=md-footer__direction> Next </span> <div class=md-ellipsis> Scene: The Blackthorn Web </div> </div> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M4 11v2h12l-5.5 5.5 1.42 1.42L19.84 12l-7.92-7.92L10.5 5.5 16 11z"/></svg> </div> </a> </nav> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Black Eyes and Broken Souls © 2024 by Paul Green is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
