After the trauma of failing to save a child from a sadistic killer five years ago, he's now a hard-drinking private investigator haunted by guilt. But when his latest bender ends with him overdosing in an abandoned church, Mick awakens with no memory of the past three days\u2014and a dark, sarcastic voice in his head claiming to be an ancient demon who now shares his body and consciousness.</p> <p>As Mick investigates missing street children with his unwanted passenger, he discovers a supernatural conspiracy involving human trafficking, occult rituals, and entities harvesting human souls. The investigation takes a personal turn when his pregnant sister is targeted, forcing Mick to rely on abilities he barely understands while evading his former colleague Detective Diana Reeves, who's growing increasingly suspicious of Mick's connection to bodies found with mysteriously blackened eyes.</p> <p>With each passing day, the boundaries between Mick and the entity blur further\u2014the demon experiencing human emotions for the first time, and Mick tapping into supernatural abilities and darker impulses. As they confront old wounds and new threats, both man and demon must decide how much of themselves they're willing to sacrifice to protect the innocent in a world where shadows conceal ancient horrors and human monsters wear respectable faces.</p>"},{"location":"characters/0.%20Character%20-%20Mick%20Hargraves.html","title":"Michael \"Mick\" Hargraves","text":"","tags":["character"]},{"location":"characters/0.%20Character%20-%20Mick%20Hargraves.html#basic-information","title":"Basic Information","text":"<p>Full Name: Michael James Hargraves Age: Late 30s Occupation: Former Detective Constable with the Metropolitan Police, now a struggling Private Investigator Physical Appearance: Weathered, showing signs of hard living;

The misguided amateurs who opened the portal wasn\u2019t for him, it just allowed him to slip through. It could be that others follow.

The author shares insights on crafting a supernatural horror world from an agnostic perspective, their unique approach to demons and angels, and the literary influences that shaped this distinctive universe.</p> <p>Interviewer: Your metaphysical framework in \"Black Eyes &amp; Broken Souls\" presents a fascinating alternative to traditional religious horror. What was your primary goal in creating this system?</p> <p>I was trying to capture the aspects of horror without falling into the vagueries of magic like you might see in something like Harry Potter. Creating a compelling fantasy framework is particularly challenging when you approach it from an agnostic or atheist perspective.</p> <p>Interviewer: That's an interesting starting point. How did you address that challenge?</p> <p>Rather than relying on traditional religious concepts of good and evil, I wanted to create a system where both demons and angels have the potential for good and evil based on their individual personalities rather than because of their origin. This immediately creates more complex characters and moral situations.</p> <p>Interviewer: That's quite different from how supernatural entities are typically portrayed. Does this change how morality functions in your world?</p> <p>Absolutely. One of the core principles in this universe is that only the act itself can be good or evil, not the actor. This creates a moral framework based entirely on consequences and choices rather than inherent nature or identity.</p> <p>It completely deconstructs the traditional concept of inherently \"evil\" demons or inherently \"good\" angels. Each entity\u2014whether human, demon, or angel\u2014is judged purely by their actions and the effects those actions have.</p> <p>Interviewer: You've also made some interesting choices regarding emotions in your supernatural beings. Could you elaborate on that?</p> <p>In my framework, humans are the only beings with true emotions, which creates interesting dynamics for morality. Demons and angels operate from pure rational consciousness without the emotional dimension that humans experience.</p> <p>This means they might make decisions based on pattern recognition, strategic advantage, or principle, but without the emotional component that drives human moral intuition. They might perform actions humans would consider horrific without malice\u2014they're simply pursuing goals according to their nature, without emotional restraints like empathy or compassion.</p> <p>Interviewer: That makes Marchosias's partnership with Mick particularly significant, doesn't it?</p> <p>Exactly. Marchosias experiencing human emotions through his partnership with Mick represents something unprecedented\u2014a demon developing emotional attachments rather than just strategic interests. His growing protective feelings toward Eliza show an evolution beyond what should be possible within his nature.</p> <p>It's a way to make humans unique and important in a universe filled with more powerful entities. We might not have the raw power or lifespan of these other beings, but we possess something they don't: the emotional capacity that gives meaning and moral weight to existence.</p> <p>Interviewer: I'm curious about your literary influences. What works helped shape your approach to this supernatural world?</p> <p>Several works influenced me. Hellblazer/Constantine is definitely a reference point\u2014particularly in how it treats supernatural elements as operating according to consistent rules rather than arbitrary magic, and the way it positions Hell as a complex political landscape rather than a simplistic realm of punishment.</p> <p>Other significant influences include Neil Gaiman's work on Lucifer, 30 Days of Night, and the Criminal Macabre series (Cal McDonald Mysteries) by Steve Niles. These all approached supernatural horror with a grounded sensibility that I wanted to capture.</p> <p>Interviewer: Hellblazer seems particularly relevant to your approach. What elements from that world resonated with you?</p> <p>Constantine's relationships with demons\u2014which often involve negotiation, manipulation, and occasionally something approaching mutual respect rather than just antagonism\u2014feels spiritually connected to how my character Marchosias operates, though the balanced partnership with Mick takes this concept much further.</p> <p>The concept of \"thin places\" where realms bleed together is also a central element in Hellblazer, though I developed this into a more comprehensive metaphysical framework with the correspondence web and detailed realm transition mechanics.</p> <p>Both works also share that noir-influenced sensibility where the protagonist operates in a morally gray area, navigating between the human world and supernatural forces with a combination of hard-earned knowledge, cunning, and willingness to make difficult choices.</p> <p>Interviewer: Your metaphysical system feels very structured and almost scientific. Was that a deliberate choice?</p> <p>Definitely. I wanted to develop a metaphysical system that functions more like an extension of physics rather than arbitrary magic. The concept of realms existing at different \"frequencies\" rather than as separate magical dimensions gives it a quasi-scientific foundation that doesn't require belief in the supernatural as we traditionally understand it.</p> <p>This approach creates a framework for horror that doesn't require the reader to suspend their materialist worldview entirely. Essence functions as a form of energy-consciousness, the correspondence web explains spatial relationships between realms, and shadow travel operates within defined limitations.</p> <p>Interviewer: One challenge in written horror is creating effective scares. Comic books and films have visual tools that novels lack. How do you approach this?</p> <p>That's something I'm still working to perfect\u2014creating that \"jump scare\" you get from movies and comics, where the next frame, panel, or page gives you that instant shock. In comics like 30 Days of Night, you can literally turn the page to reveal something terrifying, while prose flows continuously.</p> <p>I'm experimenting with techniques like manipulating pacing\u2014building tension with longer passages, then suddenly shifting to short, punchy sentences when the horror reveals itself. Using paragraph breaks strategically can function similarly to the gutter between comic panels. Sensory misdirection is also effective\u2014focusing the reader's attention on one detail, then abruptly introducing the threat from somewhere else.</p> <p>Interviewer: Your approach to angels is particularly interesting\u2014they're potentially more dangerous than demons in some ways. Could you explain that concept?</p> <p>In my framework, celestial entities aren't malevolent, but their fundamental nature\u2014their drive to impose perfect order\u2014could be catastrophic when encountering the necessary chaos of the Material Realm. What Celestial perspective perceives as disorder in our world actually represents necessary complexity\u2014evolution requires deviation from pattern, free will necessitates the possibility of imperfection.</p> <p>When a Celestial being enters the Material Realm, its fundamental nature compels it to impose order\u2014attempting to reshape reality according to \"correct\" patterns, eliminating elements that disrupt perceived harmony. Unlike demons who typically seek experience or resources, Celestial entities automatically attempt to \"correct\" what they perceive as broken\u2014potentially destroying the very foundations of Material existence in the process.</p> <p>This creates a more interesting dynamic than the traditional \"demons bad, angels good\" framework.</p> <p>Interviewer: That creates a fascinating balance in your cosmology. Where do you see this series heading in terms of exploring these metaphysical concepts?</p> <p>The partnership between Mick and Marchosias represents a genuinely open-ended evolutionary experiment\u2014potentially indicating new possibilities for consciousness development across all realms. I'm interested in exploring what happens when beings transcend their original categories and develop into something unprecedented.</p> <p>I also want to further explore the consequences of the Blackthorn Initiative's industrial-scale exploitation of thin places, which risks permanent damage to the fundamental structure of reality itself. The tension between scientific exploitation and natural metaphysical balance creates rich territory for both horror and philosophical exploration.</p> <p>At its core, this series is about questioning categorical limitations and exploring what happens when boundaries\u2014between realms, between species, between good and evil\u2014start to break down.</p> <p>Interviewer: Thank you for sharing these insights into your fascinating world. Any final thoughts for readers new to \"Black Eyes &amp; Broken Souls\"?</p> <p>I'd encourage readers to approach this world with openness to a different kind of supernatural framework\u2014one that asks questions rather than providing absolute answers. The horror emerges not from simplistic evil but from the realization that powerful entities are operating according to their own complex agendas in a universe that might be indifferent to human suffering.</p> <p>But it's also a world where choice matters more than nature, where evolution beyond original limitations is possible, and where the uniquely human capacity for emotion might ultimately prove more significant than any supernatural power.</p> <p>\"Black Eyes &amp; Broken Souls\" and its sequel \"Blood Tithe\" explore a richly detailed metaphysical universe where realms overlap at different frequencies of existence, demons and angels defy traditional moral categories, and the boundaries between human and supernatural continue to blur in unexpected

Its gothic architecture remained largely intact\u2014flying buttresses and stone gargoyles watching over a dance floor where stained glass had once filtered sunlight. Now, red and blue lights pulsed across writhing bodies as bass-heavy music vibrated the ancient foundations.</p> <p>Mick stood in the shadows of what had once been the choir loft, surveying the scene below. Without Marchosias's enhanced vision, the club appeared ordinary\u2014just another London nightspot where beautiful people engaged in the ancient ritual of courtship through movement and alcohol.</p> <p>But Mick knew better. He'd been here once before, with Marchosias active within him, and had seen what truly lurked beneath the surface\u2014entities that were not human mingling freely with the unsuspecting, feeding on emotions, desires, and sometimes more tangible essence.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, he would never have returned alone. But normal circumstances had ended when Marchosias went silent, and desperation made for strange bedfellows.</p> <p>\"He actually came,\" a voice purred from behind him\u2014feminine, cultured, with an accent Mick couldn't quite place. \"The famous detective without his demon. How... vulnerable you look.\"</p> <p>Mick turned to face the speaker, keeping his expression neutral despite the chill that ran down his spine. \"Lilaeth. Thank you for agreeing to meet me.\"</p> <p>The woman before him appeared to be in her thirties, with porcelain skin and hair so black it seemed to absorb light. She wore a crimson dress that moved too fluidly, as if responding to currents other than her movements. To ordinary eyes, she would appear merely striking\u2014beautiful in a severe, intimidating way.</p> <p>But Mick knew what lurked beneath that careful disguise\u2014a lesser demon, an information broker who traded in secrets across realms. Marchosias had introduced them during an earlier case, making it very clear that while Lilaeth could be useful, she was never to be trusted.</p> <p>\"Curiosity compelled me,\" she replied, moving closer with a predator's grace. \"The mortal who hosts Marchosias, suddenly alone. I had to see for myself.\" Her eyes, seemingly human, briefly flashed with vertical pupils. \"What happened to him? Is he... gone?\"</p> <p>\"Not gone,\" Mick replied carefully. \"Dormant. Trapped.\"</p> <p>\"Fascinating.\" She circled him slowly, like a shark scenting blood. \"And here you are, seeking my help. How desperate you must be.\"</p> <p>\"I need information,\" Mick said, getting directly to the point. \"About the Blackthorn Initiative. About what they're doing to demons.\"</p> <p>Lilaeth's expression hardened. \"That name is becoming most unwelcome in certain circles. They are... disrupting established patterns.\"</p> <p>\"They're harvesting demonic essence,\" Mick said, watching for her reaction. \"Creating human-demon hybrids without consent from either side.\"</p> <p>The flash of genuine rage that crossed her features confirmed his suspicions. \"Abominations,\" she hissed, her disguise slipping momentarily to reveal something scaled and ancient beneath. \"They take what is not freely given. They bind essence never meant to be contained.\"</p> <p>\"Then help me stop them,\" Mick pressed. \"Tell me what you know.\"</p> <p>Lilaeth's laugh was like glass breaking. \"Information has a price, detective. Especially for one so... unprotected.\"</p> <p>\"Name it.\"</p> <p>She smiled, revealing teeth too sharp to be human. \"Not so fast. First, I must know\u2014what became of Marchosias? What could possibly silence a Great Marquis?\"</p> <p>Mick hesitated. Revealing weakness was dangerous, but without Lilaeth's information, he had few other leads. \"A binding artifact. Disguised as an object in Judge Blackwood's chambers.\"</p> <p>\"Clever,\" Lilaeth murmured. \"Such bindings are rare and difficult to create. Someone with considerable knowledge and resources would be required.\"</p> <p>\"Can it be broken?\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps.\" Her eyes gleamed with calculation. \"That would be a second piece of information, with its own price.\"</p> <p>Mick had expected this. Demons like Lilaeth never gave anything freely. \"I'm willing to negotiate, but I need assurance that your information is accurate.\"</p> <p>\"You doubt me?\" She pressed a hand to her chest in mock offense. \"I'm wounded.\"</p> <p>\"Cut the act,\" Mick said flatly. \"Marchosias may be silent, but I remember everything he told me about your kind. You can't lie directly, but you can mislead. I want your oath that the information will be complete and accurate.\"</p> <p>Lilaeth's expression shifted from amusement to something more calculating. \"Very good, detective. Marchosias taught you well.\" She extended her hand, a small blue flame dancing on her palm. \"I swear by the old bindings that what I tell you of the Blackthorn Initiative will be accurate and complete to my knowledge.\"</p> <p>The flame jumped from her hand to hover between them\u2014a physical manifestation of her oath. It wasn't foolproof\u2014demons were experts at finding loopholes\u2014but it was better than nothing.</p> <p>\"Now,\" she continued, \"my price for this first piece of information: a memory.\"</p> <p>Mick tensed. \"What kind of memory?\"</p> <p>\"One of Marchosias,\" she said, her voice softening with what seemed like genuine interest. \"A moment when he revealed something of his true nature to you. Something... personal.\"</p> <p>Of all the possible demands, this wasn't what Mick had expected. \"Why?\"</p> <p>Lilaeth's expression became unreadable. \"Marchosias and I have... history. From before his fall. The memory would be for my own purposes, not to be shared or used against either of you.\"</p> <p>Mick considered carefully. Memories were precious, intimate things, but if this could lead him to freeing Marchosias...</p> <p>\"Fine,\" he agreed. \"But I choose which memory.\"</p> <p>\"Acceptable.\"</p> <p>Mick closed his eyes, sifting through his experiences with Marchosias. Most were too personal, too revealing of weaknesses, or too strategic to share. But there was one\u2014a quiet moment after they'd returned from Hell, when Marchosias had briefly spoken of what he missed from his existence before falling.</p> <p>\"How does this work?\" Mick asked, opening his eyes.</p> <p>Lilaeth stepped closer, her perfume carrying notes of incense and something metallic. \"Simply hold the memory in your mind and meet my gaze. I will do the rest.\"</p> <p>Mick focused on the memory\u2014Marchosias's wistful description of flight above celestial realms, of what stars looked like to beings that existed partly beyond physical space\u2014then met Lilaeth's eyes.</p> <p>The sensation was immediate and invasive\u2014like fingers rifling through his thoughts, selecting and extracting the specific memory with surgical precision. It didn't hurt, exactly, but left him feeling exposed in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable.</p> <p>When it was done, Lilaeth stepped back, something like wonder crossing her features. \"He still remembers the music,\" she murmured, almost to herself.</p> <p>Mick swayed slightly, steadying himself against the railing. \"Your turn. The Blackthorn Initiative. What do you know?\"</p> <p>Composing herself, Lilaeth's expression returned to its careful neutrality. \"They have discovered ancient techniques for extracting demonic essence from thin places\u2014locations where the barriers between realms naturally weaken. They are not the first to attempt such methods, but they are the first to succeed on this scale.\"</p> <p>\"Who's behind it?\"</p> <p>\"Three principals,\" she replied. \"The public face is Thomas Blackthorn, a human with old grievances against demonkind. His money funds everything. Dr. Eleanor Crane provides the scientific expertise\u2014she has been studying demonic physiology for decades. And Professor Martin Keyes discovered the extraction method in forbidden texts from Alexandria's lost library.\"</p> <p>\"And the purpose?\" Mick pressed. \"Why harvest demonic essence?\"</p> <p>\"Power,\" Lilaeth said simply. \"But not in the way humans typically seek it. They believe they can weaponize demonic abilities without the limitations demons face in your realm\u2014creating soldiers who can wield infernal power without being constrained by wards, holy ground, or daylight.\"</p> <p>\"The Hollow Men,\" Mick said, thinking of Jeffrey Watts and his horrific transformation.</p> <p>\"Is that what they're calling them?\" Lilaeth looked genuinely disgusted. \"Fitting. They hollow out humans to make room for stolen essence, creating abominations that are neither human nor demon, but broken fragments of both.\"</p> <p>\"How do I stop them?\"</p> <p>\"That would be another piece of information,\" Lilaeth smiled thinly. \"With its own price.\"</p> <p>Mick had expected this. \"Name it.\"</p> <p>\"Blood,\" she said, her eyes gleaming. \"Three drops, freely given.\"</p> <p>Blood had power\u2014Marchosias had taught him that much. It could be used in tracking spells, in bindings, in countless rituals both benign and terrible. Giving it to another demon was risky.</p> <p>\"What would you use it for?\" Mick asked warily.</p> <p>\"That's not part of our deal,\" Lilaeth replied. \"But I will tell you this much\u2014I have no interest in harming you or Marchosias. Quite the opposite.\"</p> <p>The blue flame of her oath still hovered between them, indicating she was at least being truthful in what she said, if not in what she left unsaid.</p> <p>\"Three drops,\" Mick agreed cautiously. \"No more.\"</p> <p>Lilaeth produced a small crystal vial from somewhere within her impossible dress. \"Your hand, please.\"</p> <p>Mick extended his right hand. Lilaeth took it in hers\u2014her skin cool and smooth like polished stone\u2014and pressed one sharp nail against his index finger. The cut was quick and precise, drawing three perfect drops of blood that fell into the vial.</p> <p>\"Now,\" Mick said as she sealed the vial, \"how do I stop the Blackthorn Initiative?\"</p> <p>\"You can't,\" Lilaeth said bluntly. \"Not alone. Not without Marchosias.\"</p> <p>\"That wasn't our deal,\" Mick growled. \"You promised useful information.\"</p> <p>\"And so it is,\" she countered. \"The truth is the truth, detective. The Blackthorn Initiative has safeguards against both human and demonic interference. Their facilities are warded against entities like me, while being too well-defended for a lone human to breach.\"</p> <p>\"Then how do I free Marchosias?\" Frustration edged Mick's voice.</p> <p>\"That would be a third piece of information,\" Lilaeth said, her smile almost sympathetic. \"For which I require... a favor to be named later.\"</p> <p>Warning bells sounded in Mick's mind. Unspecified favors to demons were notoriously dangerous. \"Not a chance.\"</p> <p>\"I thought not,\" Lilaeth sighed. \"Then I will give you a... hint, let's say. As a professional courtesy.\" She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"The binding used on Marchosias works through connection and reflection. What silences him is tied to him. Break the connection, break the binding.\"</p> <p>\"That's not very specific,\" Mick said, frustration evident.</p> <p>\"It's not meant to be,\" Lilaeth replied. \"Bindings this powerful require specific counters. You need something unique to Marchosias, something that resonates with his true nature.\"</p> <p>A thought struck Mick\u2014Eliza's strange drawings. The child had seen Marchosias's true form, had somehow pierced the veil between worlds. Could she perceive the binding as well?</p> <p>Lilaeth must have read something in his expression. \"You've thought of something,\" she observed. \"Good. Because time is shorter than you realize.\"</p> <p>\"What do you mean?\"</p> <p>\"The Blackthorn Initiative is approaching a critical phase,\" she explained, the blue flame of her oath still ensuring her truthfulness. \"They've acquired enough essence for something they're calling the 'Aggregation'\u2014a mass infusion into a specially prepared vessel. Something beyond their previous experiments.\"</p> <p>\"When?\"</p> <p>\"The dark moon. Three nights from now.\" She stepped back, the flame fading between them as their deal concluded. \"Find a way to wake Marchosias before then, detective. What the Blackthorn Initiative plans will tear holes in the barriers between realms\u2014damage that will affect both our kinds.\"</p> <p>Mick processed this, the implications settling like lead in his stomach. \"Why help me at all? What's your stake in this?\"</p> <p>Lilaeth's expression became unreadable again. \"Let's say I prefer the established order, with all its flaws. What the Blackthorn Initiative represents is chaos\u2014unpredictable and uncontrollable. No one, human or demon, benefits from such instability.\"</p> <p>She turned to leave, then paused. \"One last thing, freely given. When Marchosias awakens, tell him Lilaeth sends her regards, and that the feather is still in her keeping.\"</p> <p>Before Mick could ask what that meant, she stepped into a shadow and was simply gone\u2014not walking away, but vanishing as if the darkness had swallowed her whole.</p> <p>Left alone in the choir loft, Mick stared down at the dancing crowd below with new eyes. How many other secrets moved through London's nights, he wondered. How many ancient feuds and alliances shaped the world humans thought they understood?</p> <p>Without Marchosias's guidance, he'd taken a dangerous gamble dealing with Lilaeth. Yet something in her manner suggested more than mere transactional interest in his predicament. The mention of a feather, the way she'd spoken of history with Marchosias... there were depths here he couldn't fathom.</p> <p>But he had what he needed\u2014confirmation that the binding could be broken, that something connected to Marchosias's true nature might be the key. And most importantly, a deadline: three nights until the Blackthorn Initiative's \"Aggregation.\"</p> <p>Three nights to wake a demon and stop a catastrophe that threatened both realms.</p> <p>As Mick made his way through the crowded club toward the exit, he couldn't shake the feeling of being watched\u2014not by Lilaeth, but by other entities recognizing a human who walked between worlds, currently disconnected from his demonic partner.</p> <p>Vulnerable, yes. But far from helpless.</p>","tags":["memories"]},{"location":"memories/Scene%3A%20Eliza%27s%20Drawings.html","title":"Scene: Eliza's Drawings","text":"<p>The caf\u00e9 was three neighborhoods away from Bob and Liz's flat\u2014far enough that they wouldn't accidentally run into Liz during her errands. Bob had insisted on meeting here rather than at home, making it clear this rendezvous was to remain secret. Mick arrived fifteen minutes early, selecting a corner table with a view of both the entrance and the street beyond.</p> <p>When Bob arrived, he carried a manila folder tucked under his arm and Eliza balanced on his hip. The toddler, now around fifteen months old, had Liz's dark hair and Bob's serious expression\u2014an oddly solemn combination on such a tiny face.</p> <p>\"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" Bob muttered as he slid into the seat across from Mick. He settled Eliza onto his lap, where she immediately began examining the salt and pepper shakers with intense concentration.</p> <p>\"Your message sounded urgent,\" Mick replied, keeping his tone neutral. The text had been terse: Need to see you about Eliza. Don't tell Liz. Tomorrow, 2pm, Blackbird Caf\u00e9.</p> <p>Bob glanced around nervously before sliding the folder across the table. \"These are copies. Liz doesn't know I made them.\"</p> <p>Mick opened the folder to find a stack of photocopied children's drawings\u2014dozens of them, each featuring similar imagery rendered in the distinctively uncoordinated hand of a toddler.</p> <p>\"She won't stop drawing them,\" Bob said, his voice low. \"The same images, over and over. Liz thinks it's just a phase\u2014toddlers fixate on things. She's even talking about taking her to a child psychologist.\"</p> <p>\"And you disagree?\" Mick asked, beginning to sort through the copies.</p> <p>Bob hesitated, bouncing Eliza gently on his knee. \"I don't know what to think. But these drawings... there's something wrong about them. Something she couldn't possibly know.\"</p> <p>The first several images showed variations of the same basic motif\u2014a black spiral with red lines radiating outward, like a stylized sun but inverted, as if light were emerging from darkness rather than the reverse. In some, the spiral was contained within a crude circle; in others, it broke free of boundaries, tendrils reaching toward the edges of the paper.</p> <p>\"When did these start?\" Mick asked, carefully setting these aside.</p> <p>\"About three weeks ago,\" Bob replied. \"She was fine before that. Normal. Then suddenly, all she wants to draw are these... things.\"</p> <p>Mick continued through the pile, finding more variations on the spiral motif, then paused at a drawing that made his breath catch. This one showed a rough human figure\u2014stick arms and legs with a circle for a head\u2014but inside the circle where a face should be was only blackness, heavily applied crayon creating a void that consumed most of the page.</p> <p>\"This is new,\" Bob said, noticing Mick's reaction. \"From yesterday.\"</p> <p>The final drawings were the most disturbing\u2014and the most revealing. Crudely rendered scenes that, despite their childish execution, conveyed unmistakable meaning. A building with black smoke pouring from it. A circle of stick figures surrounding what might be an altar. And most tellingly, a larger figure that appeared to be sleeping or trapped, surrounded by a dark barrier.</p> <p>Marchosias. It had to be. Somehow, Eliza could see him, even in his dormant state.</p> <p>\"Has she said anything about these?\" Mick asked, keeping his voice carefully neutral.</p> <p>\"Nothing coherent. She's only just starting to form words,\" Bob replied. \"But when she draws, she gets... focused. Almost trancelike. It's not normal, Mick. Not for a baby her age.\"</p> <p>As if sensing they were discussing her, Eliza looked up from the salt shaker she'd been examining. Her gaze fixed on Mick with an intensity that seemed impossible in one so young.</p> <p>\"Dark,\" she said suddenly, pointing at Mick's chest. \"Dark man.\"</p> <p>Bob paled. \"That's the other thing. She keeps saying that. Liz thinks she's talking about shadows in her room, but...\"</p> <p>\"Dark man!\" Eliza repeated more insistently, struggling to climb onto the table toward Mick.</p> <p>Bob adjusted his grip on his daughter. \"She's never like this. Normally she's shy with people she doesn't see often.\"</p> <p>\"How much does Liz remember?\" Mick asked carefully. \"About what happened before Eliza was born?\"</p> <p>Bob's expression hardened. \"Nothing. And that's how it should stay. She believes it was an attempted ransom kidnapping that went wrong\u2014thankfully with no harm to her or the baby. The trauma specialist said the memory gaps are normal, a way of protecting herself.\"</p> <p>\"And that's what you've told her about these drawings?\"</p> <p>\"I haven't told her anything,\" Bob said sharply. \"I said I was taking Eliza to the park. I don't like lying to my wife, but I like the alternative even less.\"</p> <p>\"Dark man sleeping,\" Eliza declared, her tiny fingers now reaching toward Mick's face. \"Wake up.\"</p> <p>A chill ran through Mick. Even as a toddler, barely verbal, Eliza could somehow perceive Marchosias dormant within him.</p> <p>\"Bob,\" Mick said carefully, \"I know you want to keep Liz in the dark. I understand why. But Eliza is trying to tell us something important.\"</p> <p>\"She's fifteen months old,\" Bob countered. \"She babbles nonsense half the time.\"</p> <p>\"Does this seem like nonsense to you?\" Mick gestured to the drawings. \"These spirals match specific occult symbols related to binding and containment. This faceless figure resembles something I encountered recently at St. Catherine's Hospital. She couldn't know these things unless\u2014\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Bob interrupted, his voice tight. \"Don't say it. Don't make me think about that again.\"</p> <p>\"I have to,\" Mick insisted. \"Because you know, even if you don't want to admit it, that Eliza is different. What happened to her before she was born changed her.\"</p> <p>Bob looked down at his daughter, who was now contentedly playing with a packet of sugar, the intensity of a moment ago vanished as quickly as it had appeared.</p> <p>\"Liz and I just want a normal life,\" he said quietly. \"A normal life for our daughter.\"</p> <p>\"I know,\" Mick replied. \"And I'm sorry.\"</p> <p>Eliza suddenly perked up, dropping the sugar packet and pointing at the drawings on the table. \"Draw! Me draw!\"</p> <p>\"She wants to draw now?\" Mick asked.</p> <p>Bob sighed, reaching into the diaper bag hung over the chair. \"She always wants to draw. That's the problem.\" He produced a small zip-bag containing crayons and a folded sheet of paper.</p> <p>Mick pushed aside his coffee cup, making space on the table. \"Let her.\"</p> <p>With obvious reluctance, Bob set Eliza on the booster seat provided by the caf\u00e9 and placed the paper and crayons before her. The toddler immediately selected the black crayon, her tiny fingers gripping it with unexpected dexterity.</p> <p>What followed was remarkable. Eliza's usual energetic, somewhat chaotic movements became focused and deliberate. She began drawing with an intensity that seemed at odds with her age\u2014a concentration more suited to an older child completing a complex task.</p> <p>The image taking shape beneath her hand was familiar\u2014the same spiral from the earlier drawings, but with new elements. Lines intersected the spiral at specific points, creating a pattern that Mick recognized from his studies of occult symbols.</p> <p>\"This is a binding sigil,\" he breathed, too quiet for the other patrons to hear but drawing a sharp glance from Bob.</p> <p>Eliza continued drawing, adding a red circle around the entire design, then abruptly switching to blue crayon to add a single curved line that cut through the spiral. When she finished, she sat back, staring at her creation with an expression of satisfaction that seemed far too mature for her tiny features.</p> <p>\"Fix,\" she declared, pushing the drawing toward Mick. \"Fix dark man.\"</p> <p>Mick stared at the drawing, understanding slowly dawning. The blue line\u2014it was a counter-sigil, the introduction of an element that disrupted the binding pattern. Had Eliza somehow perceived the exact counter-sigil needed to free Marchosias?</p> <p>\"What is she talking about?\" Bob asked, his voice tight with concern.</p> <p>Mick carefully picked up the drawing, studying the blue line that intersected the binding sigil. \"She's helping,\" he said simply. \"More than she knows.\"</p> <p>Eliza had already grabbed another sheet of paper that Bob reluctantly provided, black crayon moving in the same deliberate pattern. But this time, she added a new element\u2014a crude building with distinctive architectural features\u2014a dome flanked by two towers.</p> <p>\"Bad place,\" she said, pointing to the building.</p> <p>Mick studied the drawing, recognition slowly dawning. \"St. Catherine's,\" he murmured. \"The hospital where I found\u2014\" He caught himself, conscious of Bob's anxious attention. \"Where I was investigating recently.\"</p> <p>\"What does any of this have to do with my daughter?\" Bob demanded, though he kept his voice low. \"I brought these to you because I thought you might recognize something, explain it somehow. Not to drag her further into whatever madness surrounds you.\"</p> <p>\"Bob,\" Mick said carefully, \"I understand your concerns. But Eliza is already involved. These drawings aren't random. There's knowledge here she couldn't possibly have unless something was influencing her.\"</p> <p>\"Something?\" Bob repeated, his face paling. \"What are you saying? That she's... possessed?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Mick assured him quickly. \"Nothing like that. But Eliza is special. What happened before she was born, the journey her soul took\u2014it changed her. Made her sensitive to things most people can't perceive.\"</p> <p>Bob glanced around nervously, as if worried someone might overhear. \"Like what?\"</p> <p>\"Like Marchosias,\" Mick admitted. \"She can see him, even now when he's dormant inside me.\"</p> <p>\"The demon?\" Bob's voice rose slightly before he caught himself. \"That's who she means by 'dark man'? Your... passenger?\"</p> <p>Eliza looked up at the mention of Marchosias, her expression brightening. \"Dark wings!\" she said excitedly, making flapping motions with her arms. \"Big!\"</p> <p>Both men fell silent, staring at the toddler. Marchosias's true form did indeed have massive wings\u2014something Eliza could not possibly know unless she truly was perceiving him somehow.</p> <p>\"This isn't possible,\" Bob whispered. \"She's just a baby.\"</p> <p>\"Babies see more than adults,\" Mick replied, remembering something Marchosias once told him. \"Their minds haven't learned to filter out the impossible yet.\"</p> <p>Eliza continued drawing, adding more details to the building\u2014what appeared to be a specific window or entrance, marked with the blue line from her earlier drawing.</p> <p>\"Fix there,\" she said, pointing to the blue mark. \"Draw blue there.\"</p> <p>Understanding crystallized in Mick's mind. The counter-sigil Eliza had drawn wasn't just a symbol\u2014it needed to be applied at a specific location. At St. Catherine's, where he'd encountered the Hollow Man. Where, perhaps, the original binding had been created.</p> <p>\"I need to go,\" Mick said, carefully folding the drawings and slipping them into his pocket. \"Thank you, Eliza. You've helped more than you know.\"</p> <p>\"You're not taking those,\" Bob protested, reaching across the table.</p> <p>Mick moved the drawings out of reach. \"This isn't just about me, Bob. People are being hurt\u2014transformed into things that aren't human anymore. And it won't stop with them. The people behind this, the Blackthorn Initiative, they're the same ones who tried to use your daughter as a vessel. Do you really think they've forgotten about her?\"</p> <p>The question landed like a physical blow. Bob paled, his hand dropping to his side.</p> <p>\"What do you mean?\" he asked, voice barely audible.</p> <p>\"I mean that ignoring this won't make it go away,\" Mick said. \"The Blackthorn Initiative is still active. They're planning something called the 'Aggregation' in three days. And given their interest in Eliza before, there's no guarantee they won't come for her again.\"</p> <p>\"Is that a threat?\" Bob demanded, anger replacing shock.</p> <p>\"It's a warning,\" Mick corrected. \"I'm trying to stop them. These drawings might be the key to waking Marchosias, and without him, I don't stand a chance.\"</p> <p>Bob watched as Eliza, oblivious to the tension between the adults, began drawing again\u2014this time, what appeared to be a figure with wings watching over a smaller figure.</p> <p>\"What do I tell Liz?\" he asked finally. \"About where these drawings went? About why Eliza keeps talking about a 'dark man'?\"</p> <p>\"Tell her you lost them,\" Mick suggested. \"As for the rest... let her believe it's just an imaginary friend. Most children have them.\"</p> <p>\"An imaginary friend,\" Bob repeated flatly. \"A demon as an imaginary friend. There's something fundamentally wrong with that.\"</p> <p>\"There's something fundamentally wrong with all of this,\" Mick agreed. \"But it's the reality we have to deal with.\"</p> <p>Bob gathered Eliza into his arms, his protective instinct evident in every movement. \"Fix this,\" he said, no longer argumentative but simply desperate. \"Wake your demon, stop these people, and then stay away from my family. Let us at least try to have a normal life.\"</p> <p>\"I'll do my best,\" Mick promised, though they both knew it might be an impossible task. Eliza's unique perception had already made her a part of this, whether her parents wanted to acknowledge it or not.</p> <p>As if sensing his thoughts, Eliza looked up from where she was nestled against her father's chest and fixed Mick with that unnervingly direct gaze again.</p> <p>\"Dark man come back,\" she said with the simple certainty of a child stating an obvious fact. \"Help.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Mick agreed, gathering the drawings. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do. Thank you, Eliza.\"</p> <p>As he left the caf\u00e9, Eliza's final drawing clutched in his hand, Mick felt a strange combination of hope and dread. The child had given him what he needed\u2014a way to potentially wake Marchosias, to restore their partnership and confront the Blackthorn Initiative.</p> <p>But she had also demonstrated just how deeply the supernatural had already marked her young life. No matter what Bob and Liz did, no matter how hard they tried to create normalcy, Eliza would never be an ordinary child.</p> <p>Some journeys changed you forever. Mick knew that better than most.</p> <p>Now he just had to ensure that the changes would not destroy them all.</p>","tags":["memories"]},{"location":"memories/Scene%3A%20Encounter%20with%20a%20Hollow%20Man.html","title":"Scene: Encounter with a Hollow Man","text":"<p>The basement of St. Catherine's Hospital had been abandoned for renovation three years earlier, then mysteriously defunded. Now it sat in administrative limbo\u2014not officially condemned, yet not in use. The perfect place to hide something that shouldn't exist.</p> <p>Mick's flashlight beam cut through the darkness, illuminating peeling paint and outdated medical equipment draped in dust-covered sheets. The silence was unnerving\u2014not just quiet, but a void where sound should be. Even his footsteps seemed muffled, as if the air itself was thicker here.</p> <p>He missed Marchosias's presence with a physical ache. It had been four days since the demon had gone silent within him, and the absence felt like losing a limb. No sardonic commentary, no supernatural insights, just a hollow space in his mind where another consciousness should be.</p> <p>\"Pull yourself together,\" he muttered, the sound of his own voice providing minimal comfort. \"Just find evidence and get out.\"</p> <p>According to the documents he'd pieced together from Judge Blackwood's files, this site was connected to the Blackthorn Initiative\u2014possibly one of their early experiments before they'd refined whatever process they were using. He'd been hoping for records, documentation, anything to explain what had happened to Marchosias and how to reverse it.</p> <p>What he found instead was infinitely worse.</p> <p>The corridor ended at a reinforced door marked \"Radiation Therapy,\" left slightly ajar. Yellow light spilled through the gap, accompanied by a low, rhythmic sound that took Mick a moment to identify.</p> <p>Breathing. Wet and labored, like someone drowning in slow motion.</p> <p>Every instinct screamed to turn back, but Mick forced himself forward. Without Marchosias's power flowing through him, he felt almost unbearably vulnerable, but he couldn't afford to indulge that fear.</p> <p>He eased the door open with his shoulder, baton extended in his right hand, flashlight braced against it for both light and as a makeshift weapon if needed.</p> <p>The room beyond had once been a radiation treatment chamber, but the medical equipment had been replaced with something that looked like a cross between an operating table and a medieval torture device. Leather restraints hung open at the sides. Tubes and wires connected to machinery that hummed with barely contained energy, gauges and monitors displaying readings in a script Mick didn't recognize.</p> <p>And on the floor beside the table, a figure in a hospital gown was trying to crawl toward the door.</p> <p>\"Jesus,\" Mick whispered, hurrying forward. \"Are you all right? I can get you out of here.\"</p> <p>The figure stopped moving at the sound of his voice. Slowly, with jerking movements that suggested severe injury, it began to turn.</p> <p>\"Don't...\" a ragged male voice warned. \"Don't... look...\"</p> <p>Too late. The man rolled onto his back, and Mick's flashlight illuminated what remained of his face. It seemed normal at first glance\u2014middle-aged, pale with shock and pain\u2014but then the skin below his right eye began to sink inward, collapsing like fabric suddenly pulled from behind.</p> <p>\"They did something to me,\" the man gasped, his voice distorted as the left side of his throat similarly depressed, creating a concave hollow where solid flesh should be. \"Put something inside... taking up room...\"</p> <p>Mick fought the urge to back away. \"Who did this to you? The Blackthorn people?\"</p> <p>A terrible, broken laugh escaped the man. \"Doctor Crane. Said I was... perfect candidate. Strong enough to... survive transition.\" His body convulsed suddenly, back arching unnaturally. \"It's moving inside me!\"</p> <p>The man's hospital gown had ridden up during his collapse, exposing his abdomen. As Mick watched in horror, the skin rippled and bulged, as if something large was shifting beneath it\u2014not like the movement of organs or muscle, but like an entity attempting to find its way out.</p> <p>\"What did they put in you?\" Mick asked, desperately trying to understand what he was witnessing.</p> <p>The man's eyes focused on Mick with sudden clarity. \"Not what they put in... what they took out.\" He grabbed Mick's wrist with surprising strength. \"They scooped parts of me away. Made... room.\"</p> <p>The skin of the man's chest suddenly collapsed inward, creating a depression the size of a fist. Within the hollow, Mick caught glimpses of something moving that wasn't flesh\u2014something dark and fluid that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it.</p> <p>\"Can you walk? I can get you to a hospital.\" Even as Mick said it, he knew conventional medicine would have no answers for this.</p> <p>\"Too late for that,\" the man said with terrible certainty. His gaze drifted to something behind Mick. \"They'll be coming back. They know... when the transition progresses.\"</p> <p>Mick turned to see a security camera in the corner, its red light blinking steadily. He smashed it with the handle of his baton, but the damage was likely already done.</p> <p>\"How many others?\" Mick asked, turning back to the man. \"How many have they done this to?\"</p> <p>\"Dozens,\" the man whispered, more of his face sinking inward, creating a geography of impossible hollows. \"Started with... volunteers. Now they take... who they need.\"</p> <p>Another convulsion racked his body, more violent than before. His back arched at an angle that should have broken his spine, but instead, his torso seemed to flatten and expand simultaneously, the hospital gown tearing as his ribcage visibly collapsed inward.</p> <p>\"Kill me,\" the man pleaded, his voice changing in pitch and texture as his throat distorted further. \"Before I'm not... me anymore. Before I'm one of... them.\"</p> <p>Mick had seen death in many forms during his years as a detective. He'd witnessed Marchosias consume souls, had traveled to Hell and back. But nothing had prepared him for the desperation in this man's eyes\u2014the horror of someone experiencing their own transformation into something inhuman.</p> <p>\"I can't,\" Mick said honestly. \"But I can try to find who did this. Stop them from doing it to anyone else.\"</p> <p>The man's expression crumpled, not with disappointment but with something worse\u2014understanding. \"Then go. Now. Before\u2014\" His words cut off as his jaw dislocated with a sickening pop, opening wider than humanly possible.</p> <p>From the impossible darkness within his mouth, a sound emerged that wasn't a scream\u2014too modulated, too structured. Words in a language Mick couldn't understand but that resonated with a familiarity that made his skin crawl. The language of Hell.</p> <p>The transformation was accelerating. Where the man's right shoulder had been, there was now only empty space beneath the hospital gown, as if someone had erased part of him from existence. The darkness Mick had glimpsed earlier was spreading, flowing through the hollows like liquid shadow.</p> <p>\"Who were you?\" Mick asked, backing toward the door, knowing there was nothing he could do but bearing witness seemed important somehow. \"Before this?\"</p> <p>Something sparked in the man's eyes\u2014a final flicker of human consciousness. \"Jeffrey Watts. I was... an accountant.\" A ghastly smile spread across his face, skin stretching too wide. \"I handled Judge Blackwood's finances.\"</p> <p>Of course. A connection\u2014exactly what Mick had been looking for, though not like this. Never like this.</p> <p>\"I'll remember your name,\" Mick promised. \"I'll make them pay for what they did to you.\"</p> <p>\"Run,\" Jeffrey Watts answered, his voice now layered with harmonics that made Mick's teeth ache. \"What's coming... isn't me anymore.\"</p> <p>Mick didn't wait to see the final stages of the transformation. He backed through the door as the thing that had been Jeffrey Watts began to rise from the floor, its movements becoming more fluid, more coordinated. Its body still looked partially human, but the proportions were wrong, limbs bending at impossible angles, torso flattening to no more than a few inches thick.</p> <p>The last thing Mick saw before he slammed the door was the creature's eyes\u2014still human, still Jeffrey's\u2014filled with terror at what it was becoming.</p> <p>He ran, the sound of his footsteps echoing through empty corridors. Behind him, something moved with liquid grace, making no sound at all\u2014a predator that knew the value of silence.</p> <p>The Hollow Men weren't just weapons or experiments, Mick realized with sickening clarity. They were crimes against both humanity and whatever demonic essence was being used to fill the voids hollowed out of their bodies. Two forms of existence, forced together in a grotesque union neither had chosen.</p> <p>Without Marchosias's power, Mick was just a man\u2014vulnerable, limited by human frailties. But as he burst through the emergency exit into the cold night air, a fierce determination settled over him.</p> <p>He would find a way to wake Marchosias. He would stop the Blackthorn Initiative. And he would remember Jeffrey Watts\u2014the man who, even in his final moments of humanity, had tried to help a stranger understand what they were facing.</p> <p>Because some horrors demanded to be witnessed. Demanded justice. Demanded an accounting that would come, one way or another.</p> <p>Behind him, in the darkened corridors of St. Catherine's basement, something that was neither fully human nor properly demonic began to hunt.</p>","tags":["memories"]},{"location":"memories/Scene%3A%20Old%20Debts.html","title":"Scene: Old Debts","text":"<p>The Lamb and Flag hadn't changed in the five years since Mick last darkened its doors. Same sticky floor, same smoke-stained ceiling despite the smoking ban, same clientele nursing the same grudges over the same cheap pints. The only thing missing was the constant sardonic commentary in his head.</p> <p>Four days of silence where Marchosias should be. Four days of feeling half-blind, like someone had gouged out one of his eyes while he slept.</p> <p>Mick scanned the pub, ignoring the reflexive tension in his shoulders. Without Marchosias's power flowing through him, he felt naked. Vulnerable in a way he'd forgotten was possible. The weight of his extendable baton in his jacket pocket offered minimal comfort.</p> <p>Gavin Saunders sat at a corner table with three others\u2014the same table he'd claimed as his unofficial office for the better part of a decade. A small-time fence with big-time connections, Saunders knew things. Specifically, things about Judge Blackwood's less public dealings.</p> <p>Mick approached the table, noting how the conversation died mid-sentence.</p> <p>\"Saunders. Need a word.\"</p> <p>Gavin looked up, his watery blue eyes widening in recognition before narrowing with practiced disdain. \"Well, if it isn't Detective Constable Hargraves. Except you're not a detective anymore, are you? Just another saddo with a drinking problem.\"</p> <p>The men at the table chuckled, sensing entertainment brewing.</p> <p>\"It's about Judge Blackwood,\" Mick said, keeping his voice low. \"Five minutes of your time. That's all I'm asking.\"</p> <p>Saunders leaned back, a smile stretching across his face like an oil slick. \"Blackwood? That's a name I haven't heard in a while. Why would I know anything about some fancy judge?\"</p> <p>\"Cut the act,\" Mick replied. \"I know you handled some acquisitions for him. Properties with specific histories.\"</p> <p>Something flickered across Saunders' face\u2014a momentary tell that confirmed Mick's suspicions\u2014before he masked it with exaggerated boredom.</p> <p>\"Don't know what you're talking about, mate. But I do know you're interrupting my evening.\" He gestured toward the door. \"So why don't you piss off back to whatever gutter you crawled out of?\"</p> <p>Mick didn't move. \"This is important, Gavin. People are dying.\"</p> <p>\"People are always dying,\" Saunders replied, his tone hardening. \"Not my concern. Not yours either, now that you've been kicked off the force.\"</p> <p>\"I wasn't kicked off,\" Mick corrected automatically. \"I left.\"</p> <p>\"After beating seven shades of shit out of that nonce,\" one of the other men added with something like reluctant respect.</p> <p>Saunders sighed theatrically. \"Look, I'm trying to enjoy a quiet drink with my mates. If you don't leave under your own steam...\" He raised his voice slightly. \"Shaun! Got a situation over here.\"</p> <p>A hulking shadow detached itself from the bar. Mick didn't need to turn to know who it was, but he did anyway, confirming what his gut had already told him.</p> <p>Shaun Tulley. Six-foot-four and built like a brick shithouse. Hands like spades and a face that had been used as a whetstone for other people's knuckles.</p> <p>\"Hargraves,\" Tulley said, his voice a bass rumble that Mick felt in his chest. \"Been a while.\"</p> <p>The last time they'd crossed paths had been the Ainsworth case. Tulley had been a person of interest, though nothing had stuck. But the incident that cemented Tulley in Mick's memory had nothing to do with Ainsworth.</p> <p>It had been Jerry Halliwell\u2014\"Ginger\" to everyone who knew him, despite being bald as a cue ball. Ginger had been Mick's mentor when he first made detective, teaching him the ropes with a patience Mick had never properly appreciated until it was gone.</p> <p>Gone because Tulley had caught Ginger alone after a shift, administered a beating so thorough that the older man had spent three weeks in hospital and taken early retirement on medical grounds. The internal investigation had gone nowhere\u2014evidence misplaced, witnesses suddenly afflicted with amnesia. The usual.</p> <p>\"Shaun,\" Mick acknowledged, fighting the urge to step back as the larger man loomed over him.</p> <p>\"Mr. Saunders doesn't want to talk to you,\" Tulley said, his tone conversational. \"So how about you and me step outside for a chat instead?\"</p> <p>Mick weighed his options. Without Marchosias, he stood no chance in a fair fight against Tulley. But maybe if he could get the man talking...</p> <p>\"Fine,\" Mick agreed. \"A chat.\"</p> <p>Saunders grinned, all teeth and malice. \"Show him the error of his ways, Shaun. Educational, like.\"</p> <p>Tulley's hand clamped down on Mick's shoulder with bruising force, steering him toward the back exit. Mick let himself be guided, mind racing through scenarios, none of them ending well for him.</p> <p>They'd barely cleared the fire door into the alley behind the pub when Tulley's fist drove into Mick's solar plexus with the force of a sledgehammer. Air exploded from his lungs as he doubled over, knees buckling.</p> <p>\"That's for starters,\" Tulley said, almost cheerfully.</p> <p>Mick fought through the tears blurring his vision, through the desperate need to curl up and gasp for air. He straightened with effort and threw a punch that connected solidly with Tulley's jaw.</p> <p>It was like hitting concrete. Tulley's head barely moved. He touched his lip, seemed almost surprised to find it intact, then grinned.</p> <p>\"My turn again.\"</p> <p>The next blow caught Mick's cheekbone, snapping his head sideways and sending him staggering against the brick wall. Before he could recover, Tulley's fist found his ribs, then his stomach again.</p> <p>Mick had been in fights before, even before Marchosias. He'd taken his share of beatings. But this was methodical. Professional. Tulley knew exactly how to hurt someone without doing permanent damage\u2014unless that was the goal.</p> <p>A split lip. A rapidly swelling eye. Ribs that screamed with each breath. Mick knew he should stay down, but pride and stubbornness\u2014the twin demons that had gotten him into trouble long before Marchosias came along\u2014forced him back to his feet.</p> <p>Tulley looked almost impressed. \"Persistent little bastard, aren't you?\"</p> <p>He pinned Mick against the wall with a forearm across his chest, leaning in close enough that Mick could smell stale beer and cigarettes on his breath.</p> <p>\"This is just business, yeah? Nothing personal.\"</p> <p>\"Tell that to Ginger,\" Mick managed, tasting blood.</p> <p>Something shifted in Tulley's expression\u2014recognition, quickly followed by irritation. \"Halliwell? That was years ago, mate. Ancient history.\"</p> <p>\"Not to him,\" Mick replied. \"He still walks with a limp.\"</p> <p>Tulley's face darkened. \"He should've minded his own business. Like you should.\"</p> <p>He punctuated this with another savage blow to Mick's midsection. This time, the pain was too much. Mick's stomach rebelled, and he vomited spectacularly\u2014all over Tulley's trousers and shoes.</p> <p>\"You fucking\u2014!\" Tulley released him, stumbling back in disgust.</p> <p>Mick didn't have time to appreciate the irony. Tulley's massive hands grabbed him by the jacket and hurled him bodily across the alley. He crashed into an industrial wheelie bin with a cacophony of rattling glass, then slid to the ground, fighting to remain conscious.</p> <p>Through swimming vision, he watched Tulley cursing, trying to wipe vomit from his shoes with a handful of napkins pulled from his pocket. The distraction was brief, but it was enough.</p> <p>Mick gathered what strength remained and lashed out with his heel, targeting the side of Tulley's knee. The joint hyperextended with a sickening crunch, drawing a howl of pain from the big man.</p> <p>\"You little shit!\"</p> <p>Tulley remained standing, but only just\u2014hopping back awkwardly on his good leg as Mick struggled to his feet. Pain screamed through every nerve ending, but adrenaline dulled it to a manageable roar. His hand slipped into his jacket pocket, fingers closing around a familiar shape.</p> <p>Brass knuckles. A souvenir from a case years ago that he'd never logged into evidence. He'd told himself it was insurance. For situations exactly like this.</p> <p>The metal slipped over his fingers, cold and reassuring. Tulley saw it and his eyes widened fractionally.</p> <p>\"That's cheating,\" he said, but there was a new wariness in his voice.</p> <p>\"No,\" Mick replied, spitting blood onto the alley floor. \"This is evening the odds.\"</p> <p>He lunged forward, driving the weighted fist into Tulley's solar plexus. The big man's breath exploded outward in a pained grunt. Before he could recover, Mick struck again, this time targeting the ribs. Something gave way with a satisfying crack.</p> <p>Tulley tried to backpedal, his injured knee betraying him. Another blow, this time to the kidney. Tulley went down hard, landing on all fours like a wounded animal.</p> <p>Mick grabbed a handful of his hair, jerking his head up to meet his eyes.</p> <p>\"This is for Ginger,\" he said quietly, and drove his fist into Tulley's jaw.</p> <p>The impact sent a shock up Mick's arm to his shoulder. Tulley's head snapped sideways, blood and broken teeth splattering across the alley floor. He collapsed face-down and lay still, his breathing wet and labored.</p> <p>Mick stood over him, his own breath coming in painful gasps. The brass knuckles had split the skin across his knuckles, but the damage to Tulley was far worse. For a moment, a familiar thrill of satisfaction coursed through him\u2014the same feeling he'd had after beating Philip Weiss to a pulp.</p> <p>But there was no Marchosias to savor the violence, no demonic presence reveling in vengeance satisfied. Just Mick, alone with the consequences of his actions.</p> <p>He slipped the brass knuckles back into his pocket and straightened his jacket as best he could. His face was a mess, his ribs screamed with every breath, but he was still standing. In that moment, it felt like victory enough.</p> <p>Mick made his way back to the pub door, each step a negotiation with pain. He braced himself in the doorway, bloody and battered but upright. The conversation inside died as heads turned to stare.</p> <p>Saunders' expression shifted from smug anticipation to shock, then to poorly concealed fear.</p> <p>\"Tulley won't be joining us,\" Mick said, his voice rough but steady. \"Now, about that chat we were going to have.\"</p> <p>He limped to Saunders' table and sat uninvited, ignoring the way the other men edged away.</p> <p>\"Judge Blackwood,\" he continued, as if the last ten minutes hadn't happened. \"The Blackthorn Initiative. Start talking.\"</p> <p>The taste of blood in his mouth was bitter, but the taste of fear in Saunders' eyes was almost sweet enough to compensate.</p> <p>Almost.</p>","tags":["memories"]},{"location":"memories/Scene%3A%20The%20Yorkshire%20Hunt.html","title":"Scene: The Yorkshire Hunt","text":"<p>The boy's leg shot out with inhuman speed, catching Mick square in the stomach. The air left his lungs in a painful whoosh as he staggered backward, barely keeping his footing on the muddy embankment.</p> <p>\"Bloody hell,\" Mick wheezed, hunched over and trying to catch his breath. \"That's the third time he's gotten me.\"</p> <p>Eight-year-old Timmy Clarke stared at him from across the clearing, his eyes solid black marbles in a face too young for the cruel smile it now wore. The child's small frame seemed to vibrate with unnatural energy as he bounced lightly on his toes, head cocked at an unnatural angle.</p> <p>\"Perhaps you might consider accepting some assistance?\" Marchosias's sardonic voice echoed in Mick's mind. \"Or shall we continue with this... masterful display of detective work?\"</p> <p>\"I've got this,\" Mick muttered, straightening up. He kept his voice low enough that the gathering crowd of concerned villagers at the edge of the park couldn't hear him talking to himself. That's all he needed\u2014the locals thinking he was as mad as they already suspected.</p> <p>\"Are you quite certain? Because from where I'm standing\u2014which is, regrettably, exactly where you're standing\u2014we're getting beaten up by an eight-year-old.\"</p> <p>\"He's possessed by a demon,\" Mick hissed through clenched teeth. \"One that apparently knows kung fu.\"</p> <p>\"Throzal is hardly a martial artist,\" Marchosias replied with the mental equivalent of an eye roll. \"He's simply using the boy's natural agility combined with his own strength. Children make surprisingly effective vessels when properly motivated.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, well, enlightening as this lesson is\u2014\" Mick began, but stopped as Timmy suddenly bolted toward the village pond.</p> <p>\"Shit!\"</p> <p>Mick lunged after him, narrowly avoiding a pensioner walking her dog. The boy moved with unnatural speed, darting between concerned onlookers with the fluid grace of something that had never been human.</p> <p>Mick's phone rang in his pocket. He fumbled for it without slowing down, nearly dropping it as he vaulted over a park bench.</p> <p>\"Hargraves,\" he answered breathlessly, keeping his eyes fixed on the small figure weaving through the village green ahead.</p> <p>\"Mick, it's Reeves.\" Detective Inspector Diana Reeves' clipped London accent was unmistakable. \"Where are you? The background sounds like you're running a marathon.\"</p> <p>\"I'm a bit busy right now,\" Mick panted, dodging around a mother with a pram who gave him a startled look. \"I'll have to call you back.\"</p> <p>\"I have something that needs your attention,\" she continued, undeterred. \"The Blackwood case. The circumstances match your... particular expertise.\"</p> <p>\"Look, I really can't\u2014\" Mick broke off as he watched Timmy scramble up a tree with inhuman agility, perching on a branch and grinning down at him with that same terrible smile. \"I've got to go.\"</p> <p>He hung up and jammed the phone back into his pocket, approaching the tree cautiously.</p> <p>\"Come on, Timmy,\" Mick called up, trying to sound calmer than he felt. \"This isn't you. Let me help.\"</p> <p>The boy's head rotated further than a human neck should allow. \"Timmy's having ever so much fun,\" came a voice that was nothing like a child's. \"Aren't you, Timmy?\" The last words emerged in a perfect mimicry of what must have been the boy's actual voice, making Mick's skin crawl.</p> <p>\"You do realize there's a simple solution,\" Marchosias commented idly. \"I could manifest just enough to\u2014\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Mick said firmly. \"No scaring the kid more than he already is. He's still in there.\"</p> <p>\"Your compassion is touching, if completely impractical.\"</p> <p>\"There has to be a connection,\" Mick muttered, circling the tree. \"Something linking the demon to the boy. Something personal.\"</p> <p>\"The necklace,\" Marchosias suddenly said, his mental voice sharpening with interest. \"The pendant around his neck. It's carved bone\u2014human bone, if I'm not mistaken. Not exactly standard playground accessories for British schoolchildren.\"</p> <p>Mick squinted up at the boy and saw a crude pendant hanging from a leather cord around his neck. \"Where the hell did he get that?\"</p> <p>\"Ask him. Or better yet, ask the demon. Throzal has always been vain about his trophies.\"</p> <p>\"That's a nice necklace, Timmy,\" Mick called up, forcing a conversational tone. \"Or should I say, Throzal? Bit ostentatious, isn't it? Wearing your kills around a child's neck?\"</p> <p>The demon's smile faltered slightly. \"You know my name, human?\"</p> <p>\"I know more than that,\" Mick replied, moving closer to the tree. \"I know you're barely a mid-level entity. I know you specialize in animal mutilations and minor hauntings. I know you're not powerful enough to maintain possession of a child without an anchor.\"</p> <p>The boy's face contorted with rage. \"You know NOTHING!\"</p> <p>\"I know you're using that bone pendant to maintain your hold,\" Mick continued, reaching the base of the tree. \"I know if I take it from you, you're finished.\"</p> <p>With a shriek of fury, the possessed child launched himself from the branch, directly at Mick's face.</p> <p>\"Duck!\" Marchosias warned.</p> <p>Mick dropped to the ground as the boy sailed over him. He spun around in time to see Timmy land in a crouch, already tensing to spring again.</p> <p>\"Let the boy go,\" Mick demanded, slowly rising to his feet. \"You're outmatched here.\"</p> <p>The demon laughed with the child's mouth. \"By you? A drunk? A failure who couldn't even save his own\u2014\"</p> <p>\"Not by me,\" Mick interrupted, his voice dropping dangerously low. \"By what's inside me.\"</p> <p>For the first time, uncertainty flickered across the possessed child's face.</p> <p>\"Let me show him,\" Marchosias urged. \"Just a glimpse.\"</p> <p>Mick hesitated, then gave a small nod. He felt the familiar cold rush as Marchosias surged forward inside him, not taking control but making his presence known. Mick knew his eyes had gone black when the demon inside Timmy took an involuntary step backward.</p> <p>\"You're...\" the creature began, its voice losing some of its confidence.</p> <p>\"He's with me,\" Mick said quietly. \"Now let the boy go.\"</p> <p>\"Never,\" snarled the demon, backing toward the pond. \"The child invited me in. He found my relic. He spoke my name. He is MINE.\"</p> <p>\"Half-truths,\" Marchosias commented. \"The boy found the bone, yes, but he couldn't possibly have known what it was. Throzal is manipulating the rules. The possession is tenuous at best.\"</p> <p>\"Last chance,\" Mick warned, advancing slowly. \"Leave willingly, or we'll make you leave.\"</p> <p>The demon's answer was to make Timmy sprint toward the pond's edge, clearly intending to flee across it.</p> <p>\"Oh, for fuck's sake,\" Mick groaned, breaking into a run.</p> <p>\"Perhaps you could have threatened him AFTER we were in grabbing distance?\" Marchosias suggested dryly.</p> <p>Mick put on a burst of speed, closing the gap. He lunged, fingers just brushing the back of Timmy's shirt\u2014</p> <p>\u2014and found himself grasping at air as the boy feinted left, then darted right with inhuman agility.</p> <p>Mick's momentum carried him forward, directly into the murky waters of the village pond. He crashed through the surface with a spectacular splash, arms windmilling futilely.</p> <p>Underwater, everything was green and brown and surprisingly deep. His feet failed to find the bottom as he flailed, disoriented. Weeds tangled around his legs, pulling him deeper.</p> <p>\"This is certainly one approach to demon hunting,\" Marchosias remarked, somehow managing to sound bone-dry even in Mick's waterlogged mind. \"Though I confess it's not one I've encountered before.\"</p> <p>Mick kicked hard, breaking the surface with a gasp. He wiped muddy water from his eyes to see Timmy standing at the pond's edge, doubled over with laughter that was too deep and cruel to belong to a child.</p> <p>The demonic mirth cut off abruptly as a woman's voice called out, \"Timothy Alexander Clarke! What on earth is going on?\"</p> <p>A harried-looking woman in her thirties hurried across the green, her face a mixture of confusion and anger. \"I've been looking everywhere for you!\"</p> <p>The demon inside Timmy hesitated, caught between flight and maintaining its human charade. In that moment of indecision, Mick saw his chance.</p> <p>\"The pendant,\" Marchosias reminded him. \"We need the pendant.\"</p> <p>Mick surged forward through the water, reaching the edge of the pond in three powerful strokes. He lunged upward, but his fingers closed on empty air as Timmy danced backward with unnatural agility, cackling.</p> <p>\"Too slow, drunk man!\" the demon taunted in a voice that was a grotesque parody of childish sing-song.</p> <p>Before Mick could make another grab, Timmy spun around and ran straight into his mother's arms, nestling against her like a perfectly ordinary eight-year-old boy seeking protection.</p> <p>\"Timothy Alexander Clarke!\" The woman held her son at arm's length, looking him over with the expert eye of a mother who could spot a scraped knee at fifty paces. \"I've been looking everywhere for you! What's gotten into\u2014\" She broke off, noticing the bone pendant hanging around his neck. \"What on earth is this filthy thing?\"</p> <p>The demon, in the perfect disguise of an innocent child, gave Mick a triumphant smirk over the mother's shoulder. But the smirk faltered as the woman's fingers closed around the pendant.</p> <p>\"No\u2014\" the demon began, but it was too late.</p> <p>\"Disgusting,\" the mother declared, yanking the necklace off with a snap of the leather cord. She held it between thumb and forefinger like a dead mouse. \"Where did you get this? It looks like something from that horrible shop your friends keep sneaking off to.\"</p> <p>The demon's eyes widened in panic as its anchor was removed. Mick, still waist-deep in pond water and looking like a drowned rat, could only watch as the exorcism he'd been struggling to perform was accomplished by an unwitting mother's disgust.</p> <p>\"I don't want to see you with this sort of rubbish again,\" she continued, and with a flick of her wrist, tossed the bone pendant into the pond. It landed with a small plop just inches from Mick's face, sending ripples across the murky surface.</p> <p>The effect on Timmy was instantaneous. His small body went rigid, eyes rolling back to show only whites. A sound began deep in his chest\u2014not a child's voice but something ancient and furious, rising in pitch until it became a wail that no human throat should produce.</p> <p>\"Timmy!\" the mother cried, grabbing her son as he began to collapse. The wail cut off as suddenly as if someone had flipped a switch, and the boy blinked up at her in confusion.</p> <p>\"Mum?\" he said in a perfectly normal eight-year-old voice. \"Why are we at the pond? And why is that man all wet?\"</p> <p>The mother turned to stare at Mick, still standing in the water with duckweed in his hair and a stunned expression on his face. \"Yes, exactly what I'd like to know. Who are you and why were you chasing my son?\"</p> <p>\"I'm a... specialist,\" Mick improvised lamely. \"Your son had a... a seizure. Just happened to be passing through.\" He gestured vaguely at the pond. \"Tried to help. Obviously.\"</p> <p>\"A masterful explanation,\" Marchosias commented dryly. \"I'm sure she's completely reassured now.\"</p> <p>\"A specialist who decided treatment was best administered from the middle of a duck pond,\" Marchosias noted. \"Very convincing.\"</p> <p>The woman didn't look convinced either, but she was too focused on her son to press the issue. Timmy was blinking up at her now, confusion clear on his face.</p> <p>\"Mum?\" he said in a perfectly normal eight-year-old voice. \"Why are we at the pond? And why is that man all wet?\"</p> <p>Mick tried to maintain some dignity as he squished across the village green, painfully aware of the crowd of onlookers who had witnessed his impromptu swim. Duckweed clung to his hair, and something that might have been a small water snail was making its way across his shoulder.</p> <p>\"That went exceptionally well,\" Marchosias said, his voice rich with amusement. \"I particularly enjoyed the part where you demonstrated your mastery of aquatic exorcism techniques.\"</p> <p>\"Shut up,\" Mick muttered, picking a lily pad from his collar.</p> <p>\"The look on your face when you surfaced surrounded by those ducks... truly priceless.\"</p> <p>\"I said shut up.\"</p> <p>\"Ah well, Throzal is banished, the boy is saved, and you've added 'pond drainage' to your detective skills. I would call this a successful day.\"</p> <p>Mick squeezed water from his jacket sleeves, grimacing at the murky liquid that poured out. His phone chose that moment to make a sad, gurgling noise in his pocket.</p> <p>\"Bollocks.\" He fished it out, water dripping from the case. The screen flickered weakly, then went dark. \"Perfect.\"</p> <p>Squishing his way to his car, Mick stripped off his sodden jacket and tossed it in the boot. He grabbed a semi-clean t-shirt from his emergency bag and used it to dry his hair as best he could.</p> <p>Ten minutes and one stop at a village shop later, he was seated on a bench with a new disposable phone, dialing Reeves' number.</p> <p>\"Hargraves,\" she answered on the second ring. \"I was about to send out a search party.\"</p> <p>\"Sorry about earlier, Diana,\" Mick said, still picking pond debris from his hair. \"Had a situation that needed immediate attention.\"</p> <p>\"Did it involve a swimming pool? You sound like you're gargling.\"</p> <p>Mick sighed. \"Something like that. You mentioned the Blackwood case?\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\" DI Diana Reeves' voice turned serious. \"Three victims so far. All found with... unusual characteristics.\"</p> <p>\"Unusual how?\"</p> <p>\"Black residue where their eyes should be. Bodies completely drained of blood but no wounds except strange symbols carved into their chests. The press doesn't have these details yet, and I'd like to keep it that way.\"</p> <p>Mick sat up straighter, pond water forgotten. \"Where?\"</p> <p>\"All within Greater London. Latest victim was found in Hampstead, near the Heath.\"</p> <p>\"I'll be there in four hours,\" Mick said, already heading toward his car.</p> <p>\"Hargraves,\" Reeves added before he could hang up. \"There's something else. The last victim... the symbols were different. One of them matched a drawing in your case file from last year. The one with the child\u2014Eliza.\"</p> <p>Mick felt a cold that had nothing to do with his wet clothes. Inside his mind, he felt Marchosias go very, very still.</p> <p>\"We need to go,\" the demon said, all traces of humor gone from his voice. \"Now.\"</p> <p>\"I'm on my way,\" Mick told Reeves, ending the call as he slid behind the wheel.</p> <p>As he pulled away from the village, leaving behind an exorcised child and a pond full of bewildered ducks, Mick grimaced at the memory of the bone pendant now sitting at the bottom of the murky water. He should probably go back to retrieve and properly dispose of it, but the humiliation of another pond dive was more than he could bear right now. Besides, there were more pressing concerns.</p> <p>\"What do you make of it?\" he asked aloud once they were on the open road.</p> <p>\"Nothing good,\" Marchosias replied grimly. \"If someone is using symbols connected to Eliza... they're either trying to send us a message or trying to draw us in.\"</p> <p>\"Either way, it's working,\" Mick said, pressing the accelerator harder as the countryside began to blur past.</p> <p>\"Indeed,\" the demon agreed. \"And I suspect we've only seen the beginning.\"</p> <p>The car sped south, carrying them toward London and whatever darkness awaited.</p>","tags":["memories"]}]}
