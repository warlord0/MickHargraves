# Style Guide: Mick Hargraves & The Demon

## Tone & Voice

The stories have a distinctive noir-tinged urban fantasy tone with elements of dark humor. The narrative balances gritty realism with supernatural elements, creating a constant tension between the mundane and the extraordinary. The prose is:

- Direct and economical, with punchy dialogue and minimal exposition
- Layered with dry, sardonic wit, particularly in the demon's commentary
- Grounded in physical sensations and concrete details (taste of whiskey, stomach cramps, cold metal against skin)
- Alternates between darkness and absurdist humor
- Uses London's urban landscape as both setting and atmosphere

## Character Dynamics

The central dynamic is the reluctant symbiosis between Mick and the demon:

- Their dialogue (both spoken and mental) is characterized by banter, power struggles, and grudging cooperation
- The demon speaks with antiquated formality mixed with dry observations about human behavior
- Mick responds with world-weary pragmatism, often understating extreme situations
- Their relationship swings between antagonism and partnership
- Both characters maintain distinct personalities even as they influence each other

## Narrative Structure

The stories tend to:

- Begin in media res with Mick engaged in PI work
- Incorporate frequent internal dialogue between Mick and the demon
- Use physical sensations and discomfort (hangovers, injuries, cravings) as plot drivers
- Balance supernatural horror with moments of unexpected comedy
- End with small shifts in the Mick-demon relationship, suggesting gradual evolution

## Stylistic Techniques

Distinctive techniques include:

- Dual consciousness within single POV (Mick's perceptions + demon's commentary)
- Noir-style descriptions of urban settings and criminal elements
- Grounding supernatural elements in physical reality and consequences
- Using Mick's alcoholism as both vulnerability and occasional strategic advantage
- Balancing graphic violence with unexpected tenderness or humor
- Applying concrete sensory details to abstract supernatural concepts

## Dialogue Patterns

- The demon speaks with slightly formal, sometimes archaic phrasing
- Mick uses clipped, direct statements with occasional profanity
- Their mental conversations often use incomplete sentences and interruptions
- Secondary characters speak with class and background-appropriate dialogue
- Contrast between Mick's external speech and internal thoughts creates dramatic tension
- The demon's speech/toughts should be italicised in double quotes.

## Pacing Elements

- Scenes alternate between tension and release
- Action sequences are described with kinetic, immediate language
- Contemplative moments allow for character development and world-building
- The demon's observations often provide unexpected perspective shifts
- Humor is used to break tension after particularly dark moments

This style guide captures the distinctive blend of noir detective fiction and supernatural horror with dark comedy that makes these stories effective. The most striking element is the dual-consciousness narration that allows for immediate commentary on events as they unfold.
