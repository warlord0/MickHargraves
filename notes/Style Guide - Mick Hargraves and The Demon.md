# Style Guide: Mick Hargraves & The Demon

## Tone & Voice

The stories have a distinctive noir-tinged urban fantasy tone with elements of dark humor. The narrative balances gritty realism with supernatural elements, creating a constant tension between the mundane and the extraordinary. The prose is:

- Direct and economical, with punchy dialogue and minimal exposition
- Layered with dry, sardonic wit, particularly in the demon's commentary
- Grounded in physical sensations and concrete details (taste of whiskey, stomach cramps, cold metal against skin)
- Alternates between darkness and absurdist humor
- Uses London's urban landscape as both setting and atmosphere

## Character Dynamics

The central dynamic is the reluctant symbiosis between Mick and the demon:

- Their dialogue (both spoken and mental) is characterized by banter, power struggles, and grudging cooperation
- The demon speaks with antiquated formality mixed with dry observations about human behavior
- Mick responds with world-weary pragmatism, often understating extreme situations
- Their relationship swings between antagonism and partnership
- Both characters maintain distinct personalities even as they influence each other

## Narrative Structure

The stories tend to:

- Begin in media res with Mick engaged in PI work
- Incorporate frequent internal dialogue between Mick and the demon
- Use physical sensations and discomfort (hangovers, injuries, cravings) as plot drivers
- Balance supernatural horror with moments of unexpected comedy
- End with small shifts in the Mick-demon relationship, suggesting gradual evolution

## Stylistic Techniques

Distinctive techniques include:

- Dual consciousness within single POV (Mick's perceptions + demon's commentary)
- Noir-style descriptions of urban settings and criminal elements
- Grounding supernatural elements in physical reality and consequences
- Using Mick's alcoholism as both vulnerability and occasional strategic advantage
- Balancing graphic violence with unexpected tenderness or humor
- Applying concrete sensory details to abstract supernatural concepts

## Dialogue Patterns

- The demon speaks with slightly formal, sometimes archaic phrasing
- Mick uses clipped, direct statements with occasional profanity
- Their mental conversations often use incomplete sentences and interruptions
- Secondary characters speak with class and background-appropriate dialogue
- Contrast between Mick's external speech and internal thoughts creates dramatic tension
- The demon's speech/thoughts should be italicised in double quotes

## Pacing Elements

- Scenes alternate between tension and release
- Action sequences are described with kinetic, immediate language
- Contemplative moments allow for character development and world-building
- The demon's observations often provide unexpected perspective shifts
- Humor is used to break tension after particularly dark moments

## Prose "Jump Scare" Techniques

Creating effective startling moments in prose requires specific techniques that mimic the visual impact of comic or film jump scares:

- **Rhythm disruption:** Build tension with longer, flowing sentences, then abruptly shift to staccato, fragmented phrases when the horror reveals itself
- **Strategic paragraph breaks:** End paragraphs at moments of building tension, then start new paragraphs with the reveal—the white space functions like the gutter between comic panels
- **Sensory misdirection:** Focus reader attention on one sensory detail, then introduce threat from an unexpected direction ("The door hinges squeaked as he pushed it open. The breathing started at the nape of his neck.")
- **Mid-thought interruption:** Cut descriptions or dialogue with em dashes or ellipses when horror intrudes ("She reached for the doorknob, wondering if she'd left the—" [new paragraph] "Something cold and wet wrapped around her wrist.")
- **Typographical contrast:** Use italics, ALL CAPS, or *unusual formatting* selectively to create visual emphasis for shocking moments
- **Perspective whiplash:** Abruptly shift from Mick's perspective to the demon's (or vice versa) at critical moments
- **Time dilation:** Stretch descriptions during moments of heightened fear, then compress action during the shock
- **Expectation subversion:** Set up a familiar scenario, then violently overturn it with an unexpected detail

## Demonic Environment Aesthetics

When depicting human interaction with demons in the Material Realm, the environment itself becomes an extension of the horror. Rather than simply monsters in normal spaces, the entire environment transforms into something malevolent and wrong:

- **Architectural malevolence:** Buildings and spaces feel sentient and hostile—hallways that stretch impossibly, rooms that breathe, doors that aren't there until they are
- **Material corruption:** Normal surfaces transform into organic, visceral textures—walls that pulse with veins, floors sticky with unidentifiable fluids, ceilings that drip with something thicker than water
- **Rust and decay:** Industrial elements corrode before the eye—metal oxidizes, paint peels, wood rots, all at accelerated and visible rates
- **Impossible geometry:** Spatial logic breaks down—rooms that connect where they shouldn't, stairways that lead back to themselves, corners that are simultaneously acute and obtuse
- **Sensory distortion:** Light sources cast shadows in wrong directions, sounds echo incorrectly, familiar smells become corrupted with metallic or rotting undertones
- **Liminal dread:** Create the sense that the space exists between realities—neither fully Material nor fully Infernal, but a bleeding wound between realms
- **Body horror integration:** Environmental features take on anatomical qualities—doorways like mouths, windows like eyes, hallways like digestive tracts
- **Temperature inversion:** Heat sources (radiators, fires) emit cold, while naturally cold elements radiate unnatural warmth
- **Gravity disturbances:** Objects hang suspended, liquids flow upward, dust particles float in unnatural patterns

## Rendering the Veil's Thinning

When the barrier between realms weakens, the transition should be gradual and disorienting rather than immediate:

- **Subtle beginnings:** Start with easily dismissed anomalies—lights flickering in patterns, reflections that move independently, sounds slightly out of sync with their sources
- **Progressive deterioration:** Escalate the wrongness methodically—first shadows deepen, then surfaces begin to change, finally spatial logic collapses
- **Reality anchors:** Maintain a few unchanged elements to heighten the wrongness of everything else—a perfectly normal clock in a melting room, an untouched child's toy in a corridor of rust
- **Perceptual disagreement:** Have Mick and the demon perceive the environment differently, creating uncertainty about what's "really" happening
- **Transitional zones:** Create areas where normal space blends into corrupted space—hallways where one end is normal and the other transformed
- **Metaphysical bleeding:** Describe how infernal essence seeps into material reality like a stain spreading through fabric
- **Sensory layering:** Overlay Material and Infernal perceptions—Mick sees both the normal room and its demonic counterpart simultaneously
- **Landmark corruption:** Transform recognizable London locations into twisted versions of themselves—familiar enough to recognize but distorted enough to create unease

These techniques should create environments that are not just settings for horror but manifestations of horror themselves—spaces that feel wrong at a fundamental level, where the very fabric of reality is unraveling to reveal something ancient and malevolent beneath.
