# Character Profile: Dr. Victoria Reid/Dr. Eleanor Crane

## The Split Personality

- **Primary Identity:** Originally Dr. Victoria Reid, a brilliant neurologist with interest in consciousness research
- **Secondary Identity:** Dr. Eleanor Crane emerged following accidental exposure to demonic essence during early experiments
- **Transformation Trigger:** Occurred during first extraction experiments with Judge Blackwood approximately five years ago
- **Physical Manifestation:** Subtle changes in posture, vocal patterns, and micro-expressions mark transitions between personalities
- **Awareness Level:** Reid has partial awareness of Crane's actions but limited control; Crane is fully aware of Reid and can suppress her
- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - Reid emerges during moments of ethical crisis or when confronted with extreme suffering
  - Crane dominates during research activities and when the Blackthorn agenda is threatened
  - Proximity to Cell 7B (where the original split occurred) can trigger unpredictable shifts
- **Current Status:** Crane is the dominant personality, keeping Reid suppressed through medication and specialized binding techniques

## Dr. Victoria Reid (Original Personality)

### Background & Professional History

- Harvard-educated neurologist with specialization in consciousness research
- Previously employed by prestigious medical research institutions
- Recruited by Blackwood after publishing controversial theories on consciousness transference
- Initially believed the research would benefit humanity by understanding the nature of consciousness
- Growing ethical concerns about the project led to private documentation of Blackthorn's violations

### Physical Description

- Mid-thirties, with naturally warm features now often hidden behind a carefully controlled expression
- Softer speaking voice with slight Boston accent
- More natural body language, less rigid posture
- Eyes show genuine emotional responses, particularly empathy and concern
- Dresses in less severe but still professional attire when in control
- Hands often in motion while speaking, more expressive gestures

### Personality & Character Traits

- Brilliant but ethically grounded researcher
- Genuinely believed her work could revolutionize understanding of consciousness
- Exhibits compassion for test subjects and growing horror at what her research has been used for
- Plagued by guilt over her inability to stop what "she" is doing
- Increasingly desperate to sabotage the Aggregation project from within
- Maintains hope that the damage can be undone

### Motivations

- Initially sought to understand the fundamental nature of consciousness for medical breakthroughs
- Now primarily motivated by a desire to undo the damage caused by her research
- Attempted to reach out to Blackwood when she realized the true nature of the Blackthorn Institute
- Has been leaving clues and evidence that might lead to the project's exposure
- Wants to free the subjects who have been used in experiments

## Dr. Eleanor Crane (Emergent Personality)

### Origin & Development

- Emerged following Reid's first direct exposure to demonic essence during extraction
- Initially manifested during high-stress research situations, gradually becoming more dominant
- Developed to handle the cognitive dissonance between Reid's ethics and the project's demands
- Contains the parts of Reid's personality capable of continuing the research without emotional interference
- Named herself after the mechanical apparatus used in the first successful extraction (the "Crane Mechanism")

### Physical Description

- Same physical body as Reid, but carries herself with rigid, precise posture
- Cold, evaluating eyes that miss nothing; gaze often makes others uncomfortable
- Voice drops to a slightly lower register with clipped, precise diction and no accent
- Minimal gestures, controlled movements that suggest discipline and absolute control
- Prefers severe, tailored clothing in dark colors
- Often wears hair pulled back tightly when in control

### Psychological Profile

- Highly intelligent and methodical, with Reid's intellect but none of her ethical constraints
- Excellent at reading people and identifying psychological vulnerabilities
- Detached view of human beings as resources rather than individuals
- Clinical approach to all aspects of the research, viewing test subjects as mere data points
- Derives satisfaction from scientific progress regardless of human cost
- Views the Blackthorn Initiative's goals as transcending conventional morality
- Considers her emergence as evolutionary progress beyond Reid's "limitations"

### Abilities & Skills

- Expert in manipulation and gaining confidence
- Highly knowledgeable about metaphysical binding techniques
- Developed many of the extraction protocols currently in use
- Enhanced analytical abilities without emotional interference
- Capable of performing procedures Reid would find morally repugnant
- Expert in essence extraction, modification, and integration
- Has refined techniques for keeping Reid suppressed
- Carries sigils tattooed on her body (normally hidden under clothing) that help maintain her dominance

## Role in the Blackthorn Institute

- **Official Position:** Director of Research and Development
- **Specialization:** Essence extraction and human-demonic integration
- **Project Focus:** The Aggregation - combining extracted demonic essence with prepared human vessels
- **Current Operations:** Oversees activities at St. Catherine's Hospital, particularly Cell 7B
- **Relationship to Blackwood:** Complex collaboration - initially partners, then adversaries as Reid's influence caused Blackwood to doubt
- **Staff Interaction:** Feared by subordinates, who have noticed her "moods" but attribute them to work stress
- **Security Access:** Highest clearance, including personal codes to all Blackthorn facilities

## The Reid-Crane Dynamics

### The Struggle for Control

- Reid occasionally breaks through during moments of extreme ethical conflict
- Crane has developed ritual techniques to suppress Reid when she threatens to emerge
- The binding sigil in Cell 7B was designed partially based on techniques Crane uses to contain Reid
- Physical proximity to Cell 7B can trigger unpredictable shifts between personalities
- Crane utilizes specialized medications and essence-infused techniques to maintain dominance
- Reid has been growing stronger recently, creating more frequent "episodes" that concern Blackthorn staff

### Blackwood's Awareness

- Blackwood discovered the dual nature of Reid/Crane approximately three years ago
- Initially exploited the situation, working with Crane on research while using Reid's insights for safety protocols
- Eventually began working with Reid to sabotage aspects of the project as his own doubts grew
- His suicide/transformation was partially triggered by his inability to stop Crane's final phase of research
- Left encoded messages that only Reid would fully understand, hoping she would find them

### Relationship with Vassago/Blackthorn

- Crane maintains the official Blackthorn connection, advancing the Aggregation project
- Reid has been attempting to sabotage the work whenever her personality can surface
- Crane bears the Sigillum Lilith mark, willingly accepted during a ritual with Vassago
- Reid is unaware of certain bargains Crane has made with infernal entities
- Blackthorn administration is aware of her "episodes" but values her research too much to intervene

## The Cell 7B Connection

- Site of the original essence exposure that created the split personality
- The cell exists at a thin place where realms naturally overlap
- Reid/Crane's essence signature is embedded in the cell's metaphysical structure
- Exposure to the cell enhances Reid's ability to surface temporarily
- Contains specialized equipment designed by Crane for essence extraction and binding
- The physical center of the Blackthorn binding network, where the counter-binding must be applied

## Narrative Potential

### Future Plot Points

- Reid could surface temporarily to help Mick understand the counter-binding
- Crane might attempt to use Mick's connection to Marchosias for her own purposes
- The struggle between personalities could mirror Mick's partnership with Marchosias as a dark reflection
- Restoration of Marchosias might require Reid's help, creating tension as Crane fights to prevent it
- Final confrontation could involve Reid asserting control at a critical moment
- Possible redemptive arc as Reid attempts to undo the damage her alternate personality has caused

### Writing Notes

- When writing Crane, emphasize clinical precision and emotional detachment
- For Reid, show flashes of warmth, empathy, and increasing desperation
- Create subtle physical cues that signal transitions between personalities
- Use the Reid/Crane duality as a mirror to Mick's own experience of consciousness-sharing
- Establish the character as a complex antagonist rather than a simple villain
