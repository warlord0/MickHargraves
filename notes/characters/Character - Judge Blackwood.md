# Judge Anthony Blackwood

## Background & History

- Served as a Crown Court judge for approximately twenty years, highly respected in legal circles
- Widowed five years before his death, no children, lived alone in Kensington
- First encountered the supernatural world when his wife was killed by a demon-possessed individual
- Her death was officially ruled as a random violent crime, but Blackwood witnessed supernatural elements
- This traumatic loss sparked his obsessive hatred of demons and occult forces
- Dedicated himself to understanding the enemy that took his wife, initially to combat it
- Co-founded the Blackthorn Institute seven years before his death alongside Dr. Eleanor Reid
- Gradually transitioned from wanting to destroy demons to harnessing their power
- Developed the philosophy that humanity deserved access to demonic abilities without demonic influence
- Committed ritual suicide as the culmination of years of preparation to become the vessel for "The Aggregation"

## Physical Description

- Man in his sixties with silver hair and aristocratic features
- Commanding presence that earned respect in courtrooms
- Meticulous in appearance, reflecting his ordered mind
- Body systematically covered in self-carved ritual sigils and symbols
- Earlier sigils were protective, while later ones prepared his body as a vessel
- The symbols created a contradictory pattern—protection against demons while preparing to receive their power
- Created a decisive, unhesitating wound across his throat as the final ritual act

## Psychological Profile

- Highly methodical and precisely organized in both professional and occult pursuits
- Transformed from grieving widower to obsessive researcher to power-seeker
- Intellectual arrogance led him to believe he could control what demons could not
- Developed rationalization that using demonic power against demons was justified
- Deep hatred of supernatural entities coexisted with growing desire for their abilities
- Believed human consciousness was superior and could dominate demonic essence
- Viewed himself as a pioneer creating a new kind of being—human will with demonic power
- Increasingly isolated as his work progressed, reinforcing his extremist viewpoints
- Willing to sacrifice others but saw his own sacrifice as transcendence rather than death

## The Transformation & Motivations

- Initially motivated by revenge and protection after his wife's death
- Evolution from wanting to destroy demons to wanting to harness their power
- Came to view demons as powerful but flawed, limited by their own nature
- Believed humans could wield demonic powers more effectively than demons themselves
- Saw his work as elevating humanity rather than corrupting it
- Developed the "Aggregation" concept—a human vessel filled with extracted demonic essence
- Prepared his own body over years to become the perfect vessel
- His ritual suicide wasn't an end but a transformation—the final step in becoming something new
- Left his signature mark to claim ownership of this new form of existence

## The Aggregation Project

- Central to Blackwood's vision for transcending human limitations
- Required extraction of demonic essence from various entities
- Focused on Cell 7B at St. Catherine's Hospital as the "primary extraction node"
- Involved systematically preparing a human vessel (himself) to receive and control demonic power
- Required specific binding and anchoring techniques he developed over years
- His body was intended to be the template for future vessels if successful
- Believed this would create a being with human morality and demonic capabilities
- The final ritual (his suicide) was designed to complete the transformation
- Carefully timed and executed to maximize chances of successful integration

## Methods & Techniques

- Developed from amateur bindings (like Raymond Finch) to sophisticated extraction procedures
- Used his position as judge to identify potential demonic possession cases
- Employed Gavin Saunders to acquire properties and early test subjects
- Established the Blackthorn Institute as a legitimate front for his research
- Identified and acquired properties at "thin places" for maximum metaphysical effect
- Created a network of extraction facilities centered on St. Catherine's Hospital
- Documented every step meticulously in journals kept in multiple secure locations
- Developed the unique "Silence Binding" technology that would later affect Marchosias
- Created various binding objects including the obsidian paperweight

## Relationships

- His wife's death created the emotional foundation for his entire occult pursuit
- Worked closely with Dr. Eleanor Crane in establishing the Blackthorn Institute
- Their relationship evolved from collaboration to competition as their methods diverged
- Employed Gavin Saunders for property acquisition and early "acquisitions" of test subjects
- Maintained professional facade with colleagues while concealing his occult activities
- Grew increasingly isolated from even his closest associates as his transformation approached
- His relationship with his deceased wife remained his emotional touchstone, though increasingly distorted by his obsession

## Key Locations

- Kensington townhouse with hidden occult study containing extensive research materials
- South London storage unit containing his most sensitive research
- St. Catherine's Hospital, particularly Cell 7B, identified as "primary extraction node"
- Various Blackthorn Institute properties marked on his maps and acquired through Saunders
- Former home of Raymond Finch at Windridge Tower, site of early binding experiments

## Legacy & Impact

- His body prepared as the vessel for the Aggregation
- Left behind extensive documentation of binding techniques and extraction protocols
- Created the obsidian binding object that severed Marchosias from Mick
- Maps and research provided crucial information about Blackthorn Institute operations
- Established the methodology for creating human-demonic hybrids
- Unwittingly provided the counter-binding techniques that might restore Marchosias
- His death was not the end but potentially the beginning of something more dangerous

## Writing Notes

- Blackwood represents the twisted reflection of human arrogance and intellectual hubris
- His transformation from victim to villain creates a compelling arc
- The contradiction between hating demons while seeking their power creates interesting tension
- His meticulous documentation provides necessary exposition while revealing his methodical nature
- The physical evidence left on his body serves dual purposes—both ritual preparation and storytelling device
- His death is deliberately ambiguous—is it truly suicide or the beginning of transformation?
- The true horror lies in how logical and reasonable his descent into extremism appears from his perspective
