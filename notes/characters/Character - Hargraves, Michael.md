## Quotes that Capture Essence

- "You can't just disembowel people and hang them up in public. Do you have any idea how many cameras, witnesses, and forensic techniques exist now? My DNA, fingerprints, fibres from my clothing—all of it could be there."

- "If you're such a powerful demon, why is it that you can't just take over my body whenever you want?"

- "Fine. Full manifestation. Save my sister. But remember our deal—only those who deserve it."

- "I've been preparing for Hell my entire life. Every drink, every pill, every self-destructive choice. Maybe this was where I was always headed. The difference is, this time it means something."

- "They know we're here. We need to find where they're keeping the children before—"

## Notes for Writers

When writing Mick:

- Remember he has a leg injury that causes chronic pain and affects his mobility
- His substance abuse issues affect his perception and reliability
- The blurring boundaries between his consciousness and Marchosias's should increase over time
- He lacks the legal authority and resources of his police days
- In the UK context, he would not carry firearms and would be familiar with batons and tasers instead
- Marchosias's dialogue should always be in *italics* to distinguish it from Mick's thoughts
- His complex relationship with Reeves should reflect both their police partnership history and her current official position
- His protective instinct toward children should be his most consistent character trait, driven by his failure with Jamie
- The emotional bleed-through between him and Marchosias creates increasingly complex reactions to situations
