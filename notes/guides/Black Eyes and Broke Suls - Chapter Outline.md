### PART ONE: POSSESSION

#### Chapter 1: The Fall

Michael "Mick" Hargraves, a disgraced former detective,
drinks himself into a dangerous stupor after a case reminds him of
his greatest failure—a child he couldn't save. Mixing bourbon with
painkillers, he stumbles through East London. In an effort to get out
of the driving rain, Mick takes shelter in St. Agnes, an abandoned
church. As he collapses from an accidental overdose, shadows thicken
around him, and whispers fill the air before darkness claims him.

#### Chapter 2: The Voice

Mick awakens in his apartment three days later with no memory of
how he got there. We must revisit the happenings of these missing
days later. While investigating his mysterious blackout, he traces
his way back to St. Agnes’ where he discovers kids, or vandals have
mocked up the altar with occult symbols. He hears a voice in his head
that isn't his own. Initially dismissing it as a hallucination from
his substance abuse, the voice persists, telling him this isn’t he
work of children. “Misguided as they are, these were not children.”
Mick gets a vision of five people hooded and chanting around a candle
lit alter. Their words open a rent in time and space and something
hideous can be seen trying to enter. One of them panics and runs,
breaking whatever spell they had conjured. The other four are also
forced to flee as the thing they sought to control breaks free of the
portal, just as the vision ends.

The missing three days and nights could be a tale of how the demon
hunted down and took the souls of the occultists that summoned it,
giving it more power in this new realm of existence. A necessary
action to prevent its return to hell.

#### Chapter 3: Struggling for Control

The voices in his head whisper incessantly, Mick believes it’s
related to his drinking and drugs. He’s having some kind of break
down, and the voices are the result of mental illness or some
fracture in his mind. Mick refuses to believe he’s possessed, it
goes against his core beliefs about religion, any religion. The demon
attempts to assert dominance over Mick, by manipulating him towards
drink. These aren’t new thoughts for Mick, he hardly needs to be
directed to drink, his alcoholism and drug addiction see to that. We
find that during moments of weakness—drunkenness, sleep, or
emotional distress.

Their first major power struggle occurs when the demon tries to
pursue its own agenda, and Mick succumbs to drink and drugs once
more. Mick finds himself a passenger in his own body, only partially
awakening and getting flashes of the demons activities. Probably as
the demon finds and consumes the last of the occultists. When he
awakens he realises he’s not in the expected hug over condition.
His mind seems sharp, he feels rested, but realises he’s lost
another two days.

#### Chapter 4: The Visit

Mick’s sister Liz, pays a visit. She’s worried about him,
again. He promised to call her, and didn’t. She suspected he’d
gone on a bender again. The demon starts with lewd comments, “She’s
attractive. I bet she can be a lot of fun.” “Stop, she’s my
sister.” “Then that could be even more fun.” “Stop it!” His
sister picks up on the strange interaction under his breath and is
worried about him. “It’s OK. I’m just a bit run down. Too much
booze. I know I promised to give it a rest, but …” “We’re
both worried about you.” “Now I know you’re lying. Bob hates my
guts.” She convinces him he needs to work, he has bills to pay, and
she can’t afford to keep bailing him out.

### PART TWO: ADAPTATION

#### Chapter 5: The First Case

Mick takes on a case involving missing homeless youth. Unknowing
with the demon's enhanced senses, he discovers clues invisible to
normal humans, he spots when people are lying to him. He’s always
been good at reading people, but this is above and beyond. The
investigation leads him to a warehouse where young people are being
held before transport. When Mick is ambushed and shot, the demon
takes control during this moment of weakness, consuming the
assailant's soul and leaving the body with black, drained eyes. Mick
awakens to find himself mysteriously healed and deeply disturbed by
what he sees, and even more disturbed by the memories of the demon in
control.

#### Chapter 6: The Interrogation

Detective Diana Reeves, Mick's former partner, brings him in for
questioning about the incident at the warehouse. “I knew it
wouldn’t be long before I saw you on that side of the table.” The
security footage shows static during critical moments, but the bullet
hole in Mick's shirt and the unexplained corpse demand answers. Mick
remains evasive and belligerent while the demon observes silently,
assessing Reeves as a threat.

Reeve’s sits across from Mick in the stark interrogation room, a
file folder slapped down between them. The security footage plays on
a monitor in the corner, frozen on the frame showing Mick sprawled on
the ground after being shot.

"Let's try this again," the ex-colleague says,
frustration evident. "How did the bullet hole, and blood on your
clothes, get there?"

Mick shrugs, deliberately casual. "This is an old shirt. I
think I fell over."

"You fell. Onto a bullet?" Reeves pushes forward a
plastic evidence bag containing the bloody bullet. "The one with
your blood type on it?"

"Maybe I cut myself earlier. I don't know."

"Cut yourself in exactly the shape of a bullet hole, and then
healed the wound like it never happened? You expect me to believe
that?"

Mick leans back, a practised nonchalance that antagonises his
former colleague. "Believe what you want. You know you don't
have enough to hold me."

Inside his head, the demon remains unusually quiet, observing the
interaction with interest as Mick navigates the dangerous
questioning.

Reeves jaw tightens as she points to the monitor. "The guy
had no wounds, no trauma. Just those... eyes." She leans in
closer. "What happened during those missing minutes?"

"I told you. I was unconscious. I got jumped, blacked out,
woke up with him already dead."

"Nobody's eyes turn completely black from natural causes."

"I'm not a doctor."

Reeves slams a hand on the table. "Damn it! I know you're
hiding something. This isn't the first weird case that follows you
around."

After his release, the demon puts ideas into Mick’s head that
Reeves has been tracking his activities for some time.

This approach accomplishes several things:

1. Shows Mick actively covering up
   what happened rather than being confused

2. Establishes the pattern of similar
   cases that might have occurred before

3. Heightens the antagonism between the characters

#### Chapter 7: Existential Crisis

After being released from questioning, Mick returns to his rundown
apartment, thoughts racing. He paces, occasionally glancing at his
reflection in a cracked mirror, half-expecting to see something else
looking back.

"You're real," he finally says aloud to the empty room.
"You're actually real."

The demon's voice emerges in his mind, amused. *"Took a
bullet to convince you? Humans are remarkably stubborn."*

Mick pours himself a drink with shaking hands. "If you're
real... does that mean it's all real? God? Heaven? Hell? Everything
I've rejected my entire life? Does that mean I’m possessed?"

*"There's far more to it than that."* The demon's
tone shifts, becoming both cryptic and weary. *"Your
religions capture fragments of truth wrapped in centuries of
misinterpretation."*

"That's not an answer."

*"You couldn't comprehend the full answer. Not yet."* A pause. *"But yes, there are... planes beyond your physical
world. Powers older than your concept of divinity."*

Mick downs the drink in one gulp. "And what about souls? That
man's eyes..."

*"You saw what happens when essence is consumed. His
energy now strengthens us."*

"Us?" Mick's voice rises. "There is no 'us.' I
never agreed to this."

*"Yet here we are, both still alive because of what I did.
What WE did."*

Mick falls silent, contemplating the impossible reality he now
faces. His entire world view has been shattered, yet he's been given
irrefutable proof of something beyond the material world.

“What is it you want from me?”

“All in good time.”

The demon falls silent, leaving Mick alone with his existential
crisis and growing paranoia.

**Chapter 8: I Scream**

Whilst pursuing more leads on the
missing youth he enters a park. The voice in Micks head asks, “What
is that unholy racket?” It’s an ice cream van. “… but what is
that delicious smell? We must go to it.” The demon sees children
eating ice cream cones and compels Mick to buy one.

In a moment of dark humour, the demon takes control to indulge a
strange craving for vanilla ice cream, finding it delicious, despite
Mick's lactose intolerance. This leads to an uncomfortable morning,
with several toilet visits, and establishes a running joke between
them. It becomes evident that the demon can manipulate or coerce
Mick, even though it’s not in full control.

#### Chapter 9: The Bleed-Through

Mick begins experiencing the demon's memories in dreams—glimpses
of an ancient existence, a betrayal, a fall from grace. Meanwhile,
the demon discovers it experiences human emotions through Mick when
he drinks to suppress his trauma. During a particularly heavy night
of drinking, the demon ultimately takes control, and whilst out,
encounters a suicidal woman, about to jump from a bridge. Looking
forward to persuading her to leap, the demon can’t shake the
emotions connecting it to Mick and his empathy causes it to bizarrely
talk her out of it, not through compassion but by describing hell's
special torments for suicides. This accidental act of "mercy"
confuses both entities and hints at their evolving relationship.

### PART THREE: INVESTIGATION

#### Chapter 10: The Hunter

Detective Reeves reluctantly goes to see Mick. “Is this shithole
that you live in, passes for what you call an office?” she looks
around his flat in destain. “Yeah, well the cleaners got the week
off.” There is a bit of banter about what have you lowered yourself
to come see me for? It turns out the coroner found a symbol, a tattoo
on the dead man’s neck that they had encountered before. An
unsolved case, that looked like a ritual killing at the time. Now
what are the chances that one of their unsolved cases ends up related
to the body Mick was found with? What is he hiding. What does he
really know about what’s going on? The demon voice offers a name of
the symbol, and Mick inadvertently says it aloud. “What did you
say? Is that was this symbol is? What aren’t you telling me?”
Mick convinces her to let him follow up a few leads. Give him a
couple of days and he’ll fill her in. “If you’re lying to me,
or spinning me some yarn, I’ll crucify you.” The demon says,
“Interesting turn of phrase. I’m quite an expert.”

#### Chapter 11: What’s in a Name

The demon wants to know more about the emotions Mick has. “Do
all humans have these terrible ‘feelings’? How do you continue to
function with such terrifying emotions bombarding your existence? The
senses like taste, smell, touch I can understand, but these
‘feelings’…” Mick now understands that even in past
possessions the demon has never integrated so fully as to experience
true emotions.

“You know my thoughts. But do you share my memories?” Mick
asks.

The demon's voice has a cautious tone. *"Yes, but there
are places in your mind your willpower will not allow me to go."*

*Mick* *contemplates this. "So there are things you
can't access?"*

*"Those memories remain for* *you* *only.
Protected by your... resistance."*

Mick takes another drink, something occurring to him. He closes
his eyes, focusing not outward but inward, following the mental
connection to the demon instead of just hearing its voice.

Suddenly he glimpses something: a vast darkness, ancient beings, a
sensation of falling. Pain. Fear.

The demon's reaction is immediate and alarmed. *"STOP!"* The force of its voice makes Mick's head throb.

The demon's voice is uncharacteristically shaken. *"You
should not go there. I am not even sure how you are able. The human
mind is a fragile thing."*

"Not so one-sided after all, is it?" A small smile plays
on the Mick's lips. "Seems we both have secrets, Marchosias."
When Mick speaks the name aloud, the demon reacts with surprise and
wariness. Mick questions if knowing the demon's name gives him power,
to which Marchosias laughs, explaining that human myths about demonic
names are misunderstandings of how supernatural entities function.
The name isn't a source of control but simply an identity—though
its revelation represents an unexpected level of vulnerability in
their connection. This conversation establishes both their deepening
bond and sets up more revelations about Marchosias's past.

*"This is... unprecedented,"* the demon admits. *"No host has ever accessed a demon's consciousness before."*

"Maybe it's because I'm not just a host any more, am I? This
is a two-way street now."

#### Chapter 12: The Pursuit

Mick discusses the tattoo with Marchosias who explains it is a
sigil that is used to mark a demons followers. “Demons have
followers?” “Humans are simple creatures, often attributing what
they cannot understand to higher powers. Following whichever suits
their whims.” This marking Marchosias is not familiar with, there
are many realms, and many entities that could be called demons.

Later that night Marchosias helps Mick trace the sigil. Not by
regular means but tells Mick that in darkness, his power is in a
realm of its own. Marchosias is able to manifest small creatures,
which he tells Mick have limited intelligence, but are useful tools
for gathering information. He sets about sending a plague of twisted
and hideous rat like creatures into the shadows. He explains that
what they see, he will see, and by extension Mick will see. Mick is
fascinated as the multiple images stream into his consciousness.

#### Chapter 13: The Confrontation

Mick contacts Reeves with information from the previous nights
activities. He can’t just blurt out he’s possessed, and a demon
told him where to start. She’d have him committed to an asylum,
maybe that’s where he should be? As he still questions his own
sanity since Machosias appeared.

Reeves and Mick argue back and forth about the source of the
information, and she’s furious that he’s still holding something
back. But when the revelation points them in the direction of Weiss,
the paedophile of Micks failure, she accuses him of perverting the
leads to suit his own want of revenge.

### PART FOUR: REVELATION

#### Chapter 14: The Truth

Forced to cooperate, Mick, and Marchosias share what they know.

Mick confesses the full story of Jamie, the child he failed to
save, and how that failure drives him to protect others now. We need
to expand on the Jamie story. It needs to be a series of torments
that Weiss led Mick to follow. Having previously tortured, raped and
murdered other children Weiss realised Mick was on to him and lays a
trail he can follow. The trail ends with a desperate choice capture
Weiss or let the child die. Whichever choice was made the child was
always going to die, but the decision torments Mick – maybe we
don’t show what decision was made, just that Jamie died and Weiss
ends up in prison.

The demon reveals it was once a higher being who questioned
authority and was cast out, now hunted by enforcers from its realm.
In his realm there are constant battles for power, squabbles that end
up with one or other deposed, and a circle of betrayal. The summoning
to this realm was just a timely accident. The misguided amateurs who
opened the portal wasn’t for him, it just allowed him to slip
through. It could be that others follow. Marchosias reveals that
taking a life force in this realm is what sustains him, but releasing
the soul and condemning it to hell is what increases his standing in
hell, the more souls the more powerful you are. Souls in hell form a
source of power, the more tortured they are the more power they
generate. Some demons collect souls for tribute to other higher
demons. Some collect and torture souls to create new demons from the
most twisted and evil ones.

#### Chapter 15: The Prison Visit

They consult someone who might understand what they're
facing—Edmund Weiss, the paedophile Mick apprehended in the Jamie
case, now incarcerated at Belmarsh Prison. Mick is vehemently opposed
until the demon senses something unusual about Weiss.

Reeves questions Weiss, with Mick present.

At the prison, Weiss recognises the demon immediately, revealing
he too has a "hitch-hiker." His demon, a lower-ranking
entity, divulges crucial information about the hierarchies of the
demon realm and confirms that Mick's demon is indeed a fugitive of
significant importance. Marchosias suggests it would be best to make
Weiss and his demon disappear. If Weiss demon reports back, there
could be consequences.

In subtle questioning Mick probes Weiss, but there’s an unheard
conversation between the demons. Heard only by Mick and Weiss, Reeves
remains oblivious.

Weiss knows about the tattoo, but won't divulge any information
and enjoys the torment that puts Mick through. Weiss’ demon
suggests it’s not a smart idea to piss off Marchosias, and that
what does it matter that Mick takes a few breadcrumbs. Weiss is
having none of it and refuses to help.

The lights in the meeting room flicker and die. Even in the total
darkness Mick can see the horrors that Marchosias manifests.
Creatures of nightmares, sharp claws and fangs. They tear into Weiss
and despite his demon protector, wriggle and writhe under Weiss skin.
Weiss convulses in terror, and as the lights come back on Weiss’
attitude has changed. His skin runs with sweat and his eyes are
filled with terror. He gives Reeves and Mick the information they
need.

Reeves asks Mick “What the hell did you do to him?”

“Nothing, I never touched him. Maybe he’s just scared of the
dark.”
