# A Michael "Mick" Hargraves Series

<img src="./logo.svg" width="250px" style="float: right;" alt="logo" />

Former Detective Michael "Mick" Hargraves has hit rock bottom. After the trauma of failing to save a child from a sadistic killer five years ago, he's now a hard-drinking private investigator haunted by guilt. But when his latest bender ends with him overdosing in an abandoned church, Mick awakens with no memory of the past three days—and a dark, sarcastic voice in his head claiming to be an ancient demon who now shares his body and consciousness.

As Mick investigates missing street children with his unwanted passenger, he discovers a supernatural conspiracy involving human trafficking, occult rituals, and entities harvesting human souls. The investigation takes a personal turn when his pregnant sister is targeted, forcing Mick to rely on abilities he barely understands while evading his former colleague Detective Diana Reeves, who's growing increasingly suspicious of Mick's connection to bodies found with mysteriously blackened eyes.

With each passing day, the boundaries between Mick and the entity blur further—the demon experiencing human emotions for the first time, and Mick tapping into supernatural abilities and darker impulses. As they confront old wounds and new threats, both man and demon must decide how much of themselves they're willing to sacrifice to protect the innocent in a world where shadows conceal ancient horrors and human monsters wear respectable faces.
