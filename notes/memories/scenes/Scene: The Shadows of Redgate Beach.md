# Scene: The Shadows of Redgate Beach

The sharp tang of brine carried in the evening breeze, mingling
with the fading scent of sunscreen and fish and chips as Paul "Stan"
Stanford made his way along Torquay's dimming promenade. A coughing
fit seized him mid-stride, doubling him over as his lungs protested
the mild exertion of his evening walk. Retirement had not been kind
to his body—thirty years with the Met had left him with a
policeman's cynicism and the lungs of a man twenty years older.

Stan fumbled for his inhaler, cursing the COPD that had replaced
the authority of his warrant card. Three decades of chain-smoking
through stakeouts and interrogations had exacted their price, leaving
him wheezing like a punctured accordion at the slightest provocation.

His breathing stabilised enough for him to reach automatically for
the cigarettes in his jacket pocket—the same poison that had
reduced him to this state now perversely the only thing that
sometimes calmed the spasms. The ritual was ingrained: the familiar
heft of the lighter, the small flame dancing in the sea breeze, the
first inhalation simultaneously soothing and destructive.

That's when he saw him. Twenty yards ahead, moving with a strange
fluidity that wasn't quite right.

Stan slowed his pace, nicotine momentarily forgotten as decades of
surveillance experience kicked in. There was something about the
figure's silhouette that had snagged in his memory like a
burr—familiar in a way that professional instinct wouldn't let him
dismiss.

The man wore modern clothes—dark jeans, a light jacket despite
the evening chill—but carried himself with rigid formality, head
perfectly level, gait mechanical despite its unusual smoothness. When
he passed beneath a street light, Stan caught his profile clearly for
the first time.

James Whitley. Impossible, but undeniable.

The face matched the photograph that had been pinned to Stan's
incident board for six agonising months a decade ago. One of four
holidaymakers who'd vanished during that strange week when Stan had
been seconded to Devon to assist local police. Only Jessica Weber had
been found afterward—her body on Redgate Beach, throat savaged,
blood mysteriously absent despite the obvious cause of death.

But the man ahead of him couldn't be James Whitley. Because James
Whitley would be thirty-eight now, with a decade of ageing etched
into his features. This man looked precisely as he had in those
missing person photographs—twenty-eight, clean-shaven, with that
distinctive mole near his right temple.

Stan's pulse quickened as he maintained his distance. He'd been a
detective long enough to trust his memory for faces. His sergeant had
once joked that Stan could identify a suspect from their earlobes
alone. This was James Whitley—or someone who could be his identical
twin, down to the specific placement of distinguishing marks.

The figure turned abruptly down a narrow alley between two
buildings. Stan counted to five before following, his breath already
growing laboured from the combination of adrenaline and damaged
lungs. Every step felt like a gamble—his body no longer the
reliable instrument it had been during his policing days.

The alley dead-ended at a brick wall, too high to scale without
assistance. No fire escapes, no doorways, no windows within reach.

And no sign of James Whitley.

Stan blinked, scanning the confined space with increasing
confusion. There was nowhere the man could have gone. The brick walls
on either side rose unbroken for three stories, the ground was solid
concrete, and the dead end offered no hidden alcoves. Yet James
Whitley had simply vanished.

As Stan moved deeper into the alley, the temperature dropped
noticeably. Not the natural cooling of evening, but a sudden,
localised chill that raised goose-flesh along his arms. The shadows
at the alley's end seemed darker, somehow denser than natural
darkness should be. His chest tightened ominously, the cold air
triggering the familiar precursors to another coughing fit.

"Whitley?" he called, immediately regretting breaking
the silence as his voice emerged as a hoarse rasp.

A soft sound answered him—not footsteps, but something like
fluid being poured—a continuous flow that seemed to originate from
the darkest shadow at the alley's end. Stan's hand instinctively
moved to his hip before remembering he no longer carried a baton. Ten
years retired, and still the muscle memory remained.

The darkness rippled. There was no other way to describe it—the
shadow moved like water disturbed by a dropped stone, its edges
becoming more defined, its depth somehow greater than the physical
space should allow.

And from that impossible darkness, James Whitley stepped forward.

Only it wasn't entirely James Whitley any more.

The face was right, but everything else was wrong. His smile
stretched too wide, revealing teeth that weren't entirely human, but
elongated canines that extended unnaturally from his gums. His jacket
hung open, revealing a chest that didn't rise and fall with breath.
Most disturbing were his eyes—normal at first glance, but catching
the distant street light in a way that reflected a hungry crimson
glow.

"Detective Sergeant Stanford," the thing that wasn't
Whitley said, its voice carrying the echoes of dried leaves rustling
in empty buildings. "How unexpected."

Stan fought the instinct to retreat, his damaged lungs already
protesting with the beginnings of a wheeze. Whatever stood before him
defied rational explanation, but thirty years of police work had
taught him to confront the inexplicable with questions rather than
fear.

"What happened to Jessica Weber?" he asked, his voice
betraying the growing tightness in his chest.

Whitley's head tilted at an unnatural angle, neck stretching too
far to one side. "Jessica. The first feeding. Insufficient, as
it turned out. Too weak to sustain the transition." He ran his
tongue across teeth that seemed to lengthen as Stan watched. "The
others proved more... compatible vessels."

Stan's mind raced, pieces of the decade-old investigation
rearranging themselves with this new, impossible context. The throat
wound. The missing blood. The dry clothes despite her being found on
a beach.

"You drained her blood," Stan said, the realisation
settling like ice in his stomach, triggering another rattling wheeze
in his protesting lungs.

"Not her blood," Whitley corrected, as if explaining
something simple to a child. "Her essence. Her vital spark. But
her constitution proved too fragile. The others were more
accommodating." His smile widened further, those elongated
canines now fully exposed. "As you can see."

The shadows behind Whitley deepened, and from them emerged two
more figures—a man and a woman, Adam Prescott and Danielle Morris,
the other missing holidaymakers. Like Whitley, they appeared exactly
as they had in their photographs ten years ago, their faces perfect
masks stretched over something that wasn't entirely human any more.
Each bore the same hungry crimson gleam in their eyes, the same
unnatural extension of canine teeth.

Stan took an involuntary step backward, his police training
warring with the primitive part of his brain screaming that he was in
the presence of predators who viewed him as prey. His breath came in
increasingly laboured gasps, his damaged lungs betraying him at the
worst possible moment.

Stanford felt his back press against the wall of the alley. He
hadn't realised he'd been retreating. His mind latched onto the
unfamiliar name as he fought against the growing tightness in his
chest. "Hargraves?"

"You've been looking for answers in the wrong places,
Detective Stanford, and now you stumbled into something you can’t
possibly understand." Whitley said, advancing with that same
fluid grace that wasn't quite walking, nostrils flaring as if
scenting something appealing.

"The shadows," Stan wheezed, understanding blooming even
as his lungs betrayed him. "You disappeared."

Whitley gestured, and the darkness behind him rippled again. "The
shadows are pathways for those of our kind. Connections between
hunting grounds."

The three figures moved with perfect synchronisation, forming a
semicircle that blocked the alley's exit. The temperature dropped
further, Stan's strained breath forming clouds before his face
despite the mild spring evening.

"You were very persistent with your investigation ten years
ago," Adam said, his voice carrying the same unnatural
resonance. "Almost discovered the pattern of our feedings."

"The others noticed your interest," Danielle added,
running her tongue across teeth that seemed to glisten wetly in the
darkness. "You were marked for observation only. Too visible in
your official capacity."

"But now," Whitley concluded, "you're retired.
Isolated. With no one to miss you immediately." He extended a
hand that seemed to elongate as it reached toward Stan. "Your
essence would contribute nicely to our work, though your damaged
vessel is hardly ideal."

Stan's lungs chose that moment to fully betray him. The coughing
fit struck with merciless timing, doubling him over as his body
fought desperately for air. Each hacking cough felt like razor blades
in his chest, tears forming at the corners of his eyes from the
strain.

Whitley paused, surprise momentarily replacing hunger on his
too-perfect face. The creatures exchanged glances, some unspoken
communication passing between them.

"Tainted," Danielle said, her nostrils flaring with
disgust. "The vessel is corrupted. Decay has already claimed
parts of it."

Adam leaned closer, inhaling deeply. "Disease. Weakness.
Insufficient essence quality."

Stan couldn't speak through the coughing, couldn't run, couldn't
fight. His only weapon now was his bodily failure, ironically
becoming his shield as the vampiric entities reassessed his value as
prey.

Distant shouts and laughter echoed from the entrance to the
alley—the sound of drunken revellers making their way along the
promenade. The creatures' heads turned in perfect unison toward the
noise, then back to Stan.

"A more suitable opportunity presents itself," Whitley
said, his hungry gaze shifting toward the alley's entrance. "Consider
yourself fortunate, Detective Stanford. Your corrupted vessel has
granted you a temporary reprieve."

Whitley leaned in, close enough that Stan could smell the
wrongness of his breath—like meat left too long in a closed
refrigerator, the scent of something once living now fundamentally
changed.

"We will meet again," Whitley whispered, breath cold
against Stan's ear. "Even the tainted will serve a purpose."

The three figures retreated toward the deepest shadow at the
alley's end, moving with that same unsettling synchronisation. As
they reached the darkness, they seemed to lose definition, their
edges blurring, bodies becoming liquid, flowing into the shadow like
water down a drain.

The last thing to disappear was Whitley's smile, those elongated
canines gleaming briefly before the darkness swallowed them
completely.

Stan fumbled desperately for his inhaler, but his hands trembled
too violently to grasp it properly. His chest constricted like it was
caught in a vice, each failed breath more painful than the last. The
darkness at the alley's end seemed to expand, reaching tendrils
toward him as his vision began to narrow.

This wasn't just another coughing fit. This was something worse—a
cascading failure as his compromised lungs rebelled completely. He
slumped against the wall, sliding down the rough brick as his knees
gave way. The boisterous group of revellers passed by the entrance,
never turning down the alley to see the dying old man or the
unnatural darkness surrounding him.

As unconsciousness claimed him, Stan's last thought was of Jessica
Weber's bloodless body on Redgate Beach—the throat wound, the
missing blood, the mystery he'd never solved. The darkness closed in
completely, and he knew nothing more.

Fluorescent lights. The antiseptic smell. The distant beeping of
medical equipment.

Stan blinked awake in unfamiliar surroundings that became
depressingly familiar once his vision cleared. Hospital. Again. The
oxygen cannula in his nostrils brought blessed relief to his lungs,
though his chest still ached from the violence of his last conscious
moments.

"Welcome back to the land of the living," said a nurse,
noticing his stirring. "You gave some passers-by quite a scare,
collapsing in that alleyway. Another day or two of observation, and
we'll see about getting you home."

Stan nodded weakly, memories flooding back in disjointed
fragments. The thing with Whitley's face. Those elongated canines.
The impossible way they'd flowed into the shadows. Had it been real,
or just the oxygen-deprived hallucinations of a dying man?

"My phone," he rasped, his voice barely audible.

The nurse retrieved it from the bedside cabinet. "The doctor
will be round shortly. Try not to exert yourself."

Alone again, Stan stared at the ceiling, trying to separate
reality from whatever nightmarish visions his failing brain might
have conjured. Ten years of police work had taught him to trust
evidence, but what evidence did he have? Three missing people never
found, and one dead body with no explanation for its bloodlessness.
Now possible hallucinations of vampiric entities walking into
shadows.

He needed someone who wouldn't immediately dismiss him as a
confused old man with COPD-induced delusions. His fingers moved
across the phone screen, finding a number he hadn't dialled in
months.

"Jack? It's Stan. I need a favour. That weird case you
mentioned once—the witness who saw someone disappear into shadows
like smoke. I need to know who handled it."

His old colleague's response wasn't immediate, but two days later,
as Stan was being discharged, a text arrived with a name: Detective
Inspector Diana Reeves, Metropolitan Police.

It took another three days of persistent calls before Reeves
agreed to speak with him, her initial reluctance giving way to
careful interest when he described exactly what he'd seen in that
alley.

"I can't help you directly," she said finally, her voice
measured over the phone. "But I know someone who might be able
to. He handles... unusual cases. Cases that don't fit neatly into
official reports."

"A private investigator?" Stan asked sceptically.

"Something like that," Reeves replied. "His name is
Michael Hargraves. I'll put you in touch."

The call with Hargraves was brief, the man's voice gruff and
initially disinterested until Stan mentioned the specific details—how
the three missing people hadn't aged in ten years, how they'd
disappeared into shadows, the elongated canines, and the drained
corpse on Redgate Beach a decade earlier.

Something in Hargraves's tone shifted then, a new intensity
breaking through the initial indifference.

"Where are you now, Mr. Stanford?" he asked.

"Torquay. Near the harbour."

"Stay in public places. Avoid shadows. I'll be there
tomorrow." A moment's hesitation, then: "And Mr. Stanford?
If you see them again, don't let them get close enough to touch you.
Their hunger has nothing to do with food."

As the call ended, Stan looked around at the deepening evening
shadows with new awareness. The darkness between street lights seemed
to stretch and reach with subtle intent. The regular patterns of
light and shadow along the promenade now resembled a vast web, with
pedestrians moving unwittingly through its design.

With shaking hands, he reached for his cigarettes—his lifelong
addiction now ironically the thing that had possibly saved his life
by rendering him unpalatable to whatever those creatures had become.
He lit one with grim irony, inhaling the poison that had both
destroyed his health and, potentially, spared him from a worse fate.

Ten years ago, he'd investigated the disappearance of four people
and the mysterious death of one. Now he understood that his
investigation had only scratched the surface of something much
larger, much darker—something that connected Torquay's picturesque
beaches to horrors beyond human comprehension.

He moved toward the brightest section of the promenade, keeping to
the pools of light cast by the street lamps. The meeting with
Hargraves couldn't come soon enough. For the first time in years,
Stanford felt the familiar thrill of a case breaking open—the
pieces finally falling into place, even if the picture they formed
defied rational explanation.

Morning couldn't come soon enough.

Miles away in London, Mick Hargraves set down his phone, his
expression thoughtful as he processed Stanford's account.

"*Vampires,*" Marchosias's voice resonated in his
mind, breaking a silence that had stretched for hours. "*Not
the fictional kind from human entertainment, but something far more
ancient.*"

"You know what these things are?" Mick asked aloud,
though there was no need to vocalise for his passenger to hear him.

"*They're a distinct subspecies of demonic entity that has
dwelled on Earth for millennia,*" Marchosias explained, his
mental voice carrying that academic tone he often used when
explaining supernatural phenomena. "*There are truths woven
into your legends, but the reality is more complex. They feed on
human essence through blood as a medium, either extracting it piece
by piece over time or draining it completely to create a vessel.*"

"A vessel?" Mick reached for his coat, already planning
the journey to Torquay.

"*When they drain a human completely, they create an empty
vessel that can house another vampiric entity from the Infernal
Realm,*" Marchosias continued. "*Three missing
persons found a decade later, unchanged—classic signs of complete
essence replacement. The fourth victim was likely incompatible in
some way.*"

Mick nodded, understanding dawning. "And they spotted
Stanford during his investigation years ago, marked him as a
potential threat but couldn't touch him because of his position. Now
he's retired, isolated..."

"*Precisely. Though his corrupted vessel proved fortunate
for him. Their kind prefers essence untainted by disease.*"

As Mick packed an overnight bag, his mind raced with preparations
for the confrontation ahead. Vampiric demons were a new challenge,
but the methods for dealing with them wouldn't be entirely different
from other entities they'd faced.

"*Curious timing,*" Marchosias observed. "*Three
vampiric entities suddenly active in the same location after a decade
of dormancy.*"

"You think it's connected to the Blackthorn Initiative?"
Mick asked, voicing the concern that had immediately formed in his
mind.

"*It would be quite the coincidence otherwise,*"
came the sardonic reply. "*Multiple supernatural
manifestations occurring simultaneously typically suggests a central
cause.*"

Mick zipped the bag closed, his expression grim. Whatever awaited
them in Torquay, it was clear this was more than just a retired
detective's encounter with the supernatural. Something larger was
stirring, and once again, they found themselves standing at the
threshold between worlds.

"Then we'd better not keep Mr. Stanford waiting," he
said, heading for the door.
