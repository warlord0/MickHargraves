## Memorable Quotes

- *"You assumed much about the nature of judgment. The universe I've glimpsed is far more complex than the binary heaven and hell your religions describe."* - Marchosias on afterlife
- "It's always dark inside." - Mick's insight that allowed Marchosias to manifest shadow-worms inside their attackers
- *"I taste the children you've hurt."* - Marchosias to a corrupted guard before killing him
- "I knew this was a one-way trip... What's the alternative? Let Baalberith win? Let my sister's child become his vessel? I'd rather cease to exist." - Mick before traveling to Hell
- *"In all my millennia of existence, no host has ever considered me anything but a parasite or master. Friend is... unexpected."* - Marchosias when Mick referred to him as a friend
- "Some pleasures are worth the pain." - Common saying between Mick and Marchosias regarding ice cream despite lactose intolerance

## Writing Style Notes

- Marchosias's dialogue is always in *italics*
- When speaking aloud through Mick, the text should be *italicized* to indicate the different voice
- When communicating mentally with Mick, the dialogue remains *italicized* but is framed with thought indicators rather than speech marks
- Marchosias has a formal, somewhat archaic manner of speaking that contrasts with Mick's more direct style
- The narrative maintains a noir detective tone mixed with supernatural horror elements
- Humor often comes from Marchosias's discoveries of human experiences (food, music, emotions)
