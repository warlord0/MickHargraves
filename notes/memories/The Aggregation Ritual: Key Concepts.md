# The Aggregation Ritual: Key Concepts

## Core Process

The Aggregation is the Blackthorn Institute's ultimate goal - a sophisticated metaphysical procedure to create human vessels with demonic powers while maintaining human consciousness and will. The process involves three distinct phases:

1. **Vessel Preparation** - Preparing a human body through specific sigils, rituals, and modifications to house demonic essence
2. **Consciousness Extraction** - Removing and preserving the human consciousness separately
3. **Integration** - Filling the empty vessel with aggregated demonic essence, then returning the human consciousness under controlled conditions

## Blackwood's Role

Judge Blackwood prepared himself to be the first successful vessel:

- He spent years carving protective and preparatory sigils into his own body
- His suicide was deliberate and meticulously planned - a necessary first step to create an empty vessel
- His body remains preserved at a Blackthorn facility, awaiting the completion of the ritual
- The ritual itself has NOT YET OCCURRED - his body is prepared but the integration has not been performed

## Failed Attempts and The Hollow Men

Previous attempts at creating human-demon hybrids failed because:

- Researchers attempted to integrate demonic essence while the human consciousness was still present
- The human consciousness resisted the foreign essence, creating conflict within the vessel
- This resulted in "Hollow Men" - partially filled vessels where neither consciousness is fully in control
- Hollow Men are neither fully human nor properly demonic - existing in a horrific liminal state

Characteristics of Hollow Men:

- Fluid physiology that moves unnaturally
- Disproportionate anatomy with limbs too long and wrongly jointed
- Facial features that never settle into fixed positions
- Completely black eyes that seem to absorb light
- Ability to distort reality in their vicinity (accelerated decay, temperature drops)
- Can pass through impossibly small spaces by redistributing their mass

## The Blackthorn Innovation

The Blackthorn Institute's key breakthrough was the three-phase approach:

- Remove human consciousness before attempting to fill the vessel with demonic essence
- Store the consciousness safely elsewhere (method still unclear)
- Only return the consciousness after the vessel has been properly prepared and filled
- This theoretically allows for complete integration without creating Hollow Men

## Technical Elements

The process requires:

- A network of extraction facilities positioned at "thin places" along ley lines
- Cell 7B at St. Catherine's Hospital as the central node in this network
- Specialized binding technology to contain extracted essences
- A precise ritual involving specific timing and metaphysical conditions

## Current Status

- Blackwood's body is prepared but the ritual is not complete
- The Blackthorn Institute is likely gathering the necessary demonic essence for the integration
- Dr. Victoria Reid appears connected to the project, with mysterious references to someone named Eleanor Crane
- Counter-binding protocols have been discovered that could potentially disrupt the entire network
