## Chapter Endings Guidelines

Avoid common repetitive ending patterns such as:

- "Sometimes [philosophical observation], but [contrasting philosophical observation]"
- Starting final paragraphs with "Sometimes..."
- Ending with rhetorical questions
- Multiple contemplative statements

Instead, if using a philosophical or thematic ending:

- Use a single, direct statement
- Example: "The hardest part wasn't the mission itself, but the weight of knowing failure wasn't an option."
- Keep it brief and impactful
- Ensure it arises naturally from the chapter's events

Strong chapter endings should:

- Tie directly to the chapter's events and themes
- Avoid clich√© wrap-ups
- Set up next chapter's action when appropriate
- Leave readers wanting more
- Feel natural rather than forced
